<p class="center"><i>SOME PRESS OPINIONS</i></p>

<p>The border line of fairyland once crossed is a bourne from which few
antiquaries return. We have had great difficulty in getting back ourselves,
led on as we were by the seductive John Gregorson Campbell, assuredly, if
ever man was, since Campbell of Islay’s day, in the innermost secrets of the
Elfin folk. Indeed, Campbell’s <i>Popular Tales of the West Highlands</i>, full to
overflowing though they are, do not seem to us to express with anything like
the same fullness and body the misty legend and wayward romance and
quaint realism of the Celtic supernatural as does this plainer and prosaic
notebook of an old parish minister between 1861 and 1891. Folklore whether
of Celt or Saxon, henceforward has to reckon with the posthumous notebooks
of John Gregorson Campbell for an indispensable section of its apparatus of
study.—<i>ANTIQUARY.</i></p>

<p>The importance of the work from the scientific point of view can hardly be
exaggerated, as its accuracy is absolutely indisputable. And yet being little
more than a collection of stories told in the simplest English, it is as enjoyable
as one of Mr. Lang’s fairy-books.—<i>THE SPECTATOR.</i></p>

<p>Altogether the volume is in its way singularly interesting, and forms a rich
mine for the folklorist. Some of the stories may be met with under other
versions, but most of them appear here for the first time and are wonderfully
varied. The light they throw upon the Highlander’s ways of thinking is
remarkable.—<i>SCOTTISH REVIEW.</i></p>

<p>Statements and beliefs are given exactly as they reached the author, nor
do I think it would be possible to detect a single instance in which wider
knowledge or prepossession of any kind has induced him to alter or distort a
fact. This rigid conscientiousness will always secure for Mr. Campbell’s work
the confidence and regard of true folklorists.... Campbell of Tiree takes
his place by the side of Kirk, and of Walter Gregor of Pitsligo, among those
recorders of folk-lore to whom the student can always turn with increased
confidence and admiration.—<span class="smcap">Mr. Alfred Nutt</span> <i>in FOLKLORE</i>.</p>

<p>Students of tradition will find much to interest them in this new collection
of Highland folk-lore, for although a good deal of the information is similar to
that contained in previous works of the kind, yet many details are new, and
even those which are already familiar have this great recommendation—that
they were obtained at first-hand from the peasantry, and not from other
books.—<i>RELIQUARY.</i></p>

<p>On the whole their can be few richer fields of ancient folk-belief, especially
of the gloomier and sterner sort, than that which was so successfully cultivated
by the lamented author of this book.—<i>ATHENÆUM.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[ii]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Campbell has escaped most of the difficulties by which his predecessors
were beset. A very interesting series of stories has been collected, and the
volume exercises much fascination over the reader. On the subjects such as
divination, spells, the devil, etc., much interesting information is given.
While scientifically thorough in treatment, the book is indeed admirably suited
for general perusal.—<i>NOTES AND QUERIES.</i></p>

<p>The tales are plucked directly from their native soil in the popular memory;
and while few of them are absolute rarities, there is hardly anyone that does
not in some way illustrate the infinite variety and the vivid imaginative
colouring, as well as the wealth of Highland superstitions.—<i>SCOTSMAN.</i></p>

<p>This volume is posthumous, and we cannot but regret that the author was
not spared to see it safely launched. It is a capital book written in a
thoroughly sane and sober spirit. In this it differs from most books that deal
with the manners, customs, and usages of the Gaels of Scotland, for in them
the wildest theories, based mainly on fanciful ideas, are treated as facts and
enunciated as truths. In gathering his material the late Mr. Campbell relied
solely on oral communications made to himself so that in every case of doubt
he could interrogate his informant.—<i>SCOTTISH GEOGRAPHICAL MAGAZINE.</i></p>

<p>Altogether the book is a notable and valuable addition to the literature of
British folk-lore not unworthy to take its place alongside Mr. J. F. Campbell’s
classic “Popular Tales of the West Highlands.”—<i>GLASGOW HERALD.</i></p>

<p>The more collections of this sort we get the better will be the verdict of all
who read this interesting book; and those who look at the question more from
the scientific point of view will echo the wish.—<i>MAN.</i></p>

<p>The fairies and tales about them, gathered by himself or by correspondents
in all parts of the Highlands and Isles, take up the half of the book before us,
the remarkable feature of which is that the whole of its contents has been taken
down from oral sources. There are many variants and many common stories
which are variously localised. Printed accounts of the fairies are religiously
ignored.—<i>THE NORTHERN CHRONICLE.</i></p>

<p>Those who are interested in our west Highlands and Islands—and who is
not?—will find Mr. Campbell’s book a perfect mine of strange, weird stories
and legends, the latter entirely characteristic of the people, the former dealing
with magic, divination, and the superstitions of fairyland. Indeed it takes a
place by itself, and a very important place, in our folk-lore literature.—<i>THE BAILIE.</i></p>

<p>The tales are very diversified. They relate to the “fairies” and the
superstitions regarding them. A chapter is devoted to augury, another to
premonitions and divination, to dreams and prophecies, to imprecations, spells,
and the black art. In short we have a very varied and manifold collection of
Highland beliefs told with great freshness and vividness.—<i>OBAN TIMES.</i></p>

<span class="smaller">BLACK WITCHCRAFT.</span></h2>

<p>Witchcraft introduces us to a class of popular superstitions
entirely different from those connected with
Fairies. Fairies, water-horses, and kindred supernatural
beings were distinct from the Evil Spirits that gave to
witches their unhallowed powers. They could not be
compelled or conjured by mortals to appear when
wanted, or enter into contracts of service. The Powers
of Darkness, on the other hand, were always at the
service of their votaries, and, by means of charms and
incantations known to the initiated, were made to lend
their aid in any scheme of malevolence.</p>

<p>A belief in magic widely, almost universally, prevails
among the tribes of mankind, and the witchcraft of
the Christian era, while it undoubtedly gained strength
and character from mistaken interpretations of Scripture,
owes many characteristics to the delusions of
Pagan times.</p>

<p>The Highland witches have of course many points<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
in common with their sisters of the south, but comparatively
there is little repulsive or horrible in their
character. Tales regarding them make no mention of incubus
and succubus, midnight meetings and dances with
the devil, dead men’s fingers, and more of the horrible
and awful, the ravings of poor women driven crazy by
persecution and torture. Neither is there mention of
their riding through the air on broomsticks, nor, like
the witch of Endor, raising the dead. Their art was
forbidden, and their powers came from the devil; but it
does not appear under what paction, or that there was
any paction, under which this power was to be got. It
was in the name of the devil, and against the name of
the Trinity, they set about their cantrips, but a knowledge
of the necessary charms, and the courage to use
them, seem to have been all that was requisite. Those
having the reputation of being witches were (and are,
for a few still survive) usually old women, destitute of
friends and means of support, and naturally ready
to eke out a miserable livelihood by working on the
fears or the simplicity of their more prosperous neighbours.</p>

<p>There are instances in which a farmer has bribed a
witch by yearly presents not to do harm to his cattle;
and we must remember that in days of scarcity and
famine, poverty with icy hand and slow-consuming
age will make people resort to shifts of which they
would never dream when food was abundant. In most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
cases, the reputed witch was merely a superstitious and
perhaps ill-favoured old woman, possessing a knowledge
of rhymes and charms for the healing of disease
in man and beast, and taking pains to <i>sain</i> her own
cattle, if she had any, from harm. Sometimes she
was also dishonest, desirous of being looked upon
with awe, and taking advantage of nightfall to steal
milk from her neighbours’ byres and corn from their
stackyards. Her powers of witchcraft satisfactorily
accounted to the popular mind for her butter and
cheese—even if she had no cows—being abundant when
the stores of others failed. In dark uncultured times a
claim to influence over the unseen powers of nature,
and to intercourse with spirits, had only to be made to
be allowed, and the mere pretension too readily invests
the claimant with awe to make it safe for any one to
denounce the imposture. Many believed in the efficacy
of the arts they practised, and in their own possession
of the power with which the credulity of mankind was
willing to accredit them. Unusual natural events and
phenomena can easily be turned into proofs of a witch’s
claim; imposture readily leads to delusion, and hence
among the poor and uneducated it is no wonder to find
witchcraft practised and believed in.</p>

<p>The power of witches was always at the disposal
of those who were willing to pay for it, and the fact
that the rewards of witchcraft did not sometimes exceed
a pound of tobacco, alone shows how much the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
urgencies of want had to do with the pretence to
supernatural powers. Unless payment was given the
witch could do nothing; her spells were then of no
avail. To explain the anomaly that witches possessed
such tremendous powers and yet remained always in
indigent circumstances, it was said the poor wretches
could not benefit themselves; their power, as might be
expected, considering the source from which it was
derived, was only one of mischief and doing harm to
others. Much of the superstition is at variance with
this popular explanation, as, for instance, the taking of
milk from the neighbours’ cows and the substance
from their butter and cheese, but contradictions and
absurdities never stand in the way of credulity and
superstitious fears.</p>

<p>The Gaelic name ‘<i>Buidseach</i>’ is identical in meaning
with the English ‘<i>witch</i>,’ a word it also somewhat
resembles in form. The term ‘<i>Bao</i>’ is sometimes
translated wizard, but is properly only a careless conversational
form of <i>Baobh</i>, a wild furious woman, a
wicked mischievous female, who scolds and storms and
curses, caring neither what she says nor what she does,
praying the houses may be razed (<i>làrach lom</i>) and the
property destroyed (<i>sgrios an codach</i>) of those who have
offended her. This is a word used in proverbs. “A
raging woman obtains her imprecation, but her soul
obtains no mercy.”<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> <i>Baoth</i>, weak, foolish, is often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
confounded with it. M’Intosh<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> makes the expression
‘<i>maca bao</i>,’ ‘a wizard’s son’ instead of <i>macan baoth</i>, a
weak or little child. “Pity of her who is the mother of
a helpless child, when May-day falls on a Thursday,”
<i>i.e.</i><a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> owing to the infant mortality of the season.</p>

<p>A common answer to the question, What could
witches do? is What could they not do? The classes
of actions, however, ascribed to them are not numerous.
They could take the milk from their neighbours’ cattle,
bring fish to their own coasts, make fishermen successful,
go to sea for fish themselves and bring home
creelfuls, raise storms, sink ships, drown those who
offended them; give strings to sailors with knots on
them, the unloosening of which raised the wind; they
could go to wine-cellars in London or Ireland, and
drink wine till morning; fly through the air with
magic quickness, and cross the seas in the most unlikely
vessels, sieves, eggshells, or dry cowsherds;
produce a wasting disease in an enemy, waylay and
endanger the belated traveller, and by their cursed
tricks keep a child in its mother’s womb past its proper
time; suck cows, and assume various shapes. They
could benefit, or at least ward away evil from a
favourite, but their power of doing so seems to have
been much feebler than their powers of mischief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>In carrying out their unhallowed cantrips, witches
assumed various shapes. They became gulls, cormorants,
ravens, rats, mice, black sheep, swelling waves,
whales, and very frequently cats and hares. The shape
was not always well chosen for the object to be
attained, a hare, for instance, being but ill-formed for
sucking cows, or a cat for drinking wine; neither was
a sieve or an eggshell a likely vessel to go to sea in,
nor a piece of tangle for carrying milk in, nor the
chimney crook a probable substitute for the cow’s
udder. This, however, is of no consequence. It is
only part of the witch’s diabolical mode of going to
work. The truth is, that these harmless animals
whose shapes witches were said to assume, being seen
in unusual places at unusual times, or conducting
themselves in an unusual manner, were converted by
the terrified imagination into witches pursuing their
unlawful practices. Many tales seem to have their
origin in vain attempts to stagger credulity, and in
that delight which people of lively imaginations
sometimes take in ‘cramming’ their more stupid
fellows.</p>

<p>In addition to change of shape, witches had a
machinery of charms, incantations, red, black, and
blue threads, magic caps, and particularly a magic
staff, called ‘<i>an luirgean</i>’ ‘<i>an lorg ohn</i>.’</p>

<p>There were certain nights of the year on which they
were unusually busy. These were particularly the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
night of every quarter. On Beltane night they were
awake all night. Their object seems to have been to
<i>sain</i>, <i>i.e.</i> keep evil away from, their own cattle or those
of the farmers who employed them for the purpose.
Others were no doubt taking advantage of any neglect
in this respect to secure to themselves the butter and
cheese for the next three months. No one, however,
knows what they were after, as a woman who believed
in their being awake on Beltane night piously said,
“God and themselves know what they are doing.”<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Many tales relating to witchcraft, as has been already
remarked, must have had their origin in attempts to
ridicule people out of their belief and in an unbridled
exercise of imagination. They only furnished a proof
that men will believe the incredible.</p>

<h3>WITCHES AND MILK.</h3>

<p>To the poor a cow is invaluable, and its ailments
are naturally a source of anxiety. Hence the poor
man has been most frequently the victim of imposture,
and his cow has the most frequently lost its milk
through the machinations of witches. The folds of
the affluent were seldom attacked, or those byres in
which regard was paid to cleanliness and tidiness.</p>

<p>The stories of witches assuming the shape of hares<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and sucking cows are numberless. A boy who saw
one described the hare as sitting on its hind legs, with
its fore paws resting on the cow’s udder. Some people
profess to have come upon the witch through the night
while thus engaged, and caught her. The hare then
became a woman.</p>

<p>When a witch assumes this shape it is dangerous
to fire at her without putting silver, a sixpence or a
button of that metal, in the gun. If the hare fired at
was, as indeed it often was, a witch in disguise, the
gun burst, and the shot came back and killed the party
firing, or some mischance followed. Old women used,
therefore, to recommend that a sixpence be put in the
gun when firing at a hare.</p>

<p>Parties who entered the house of a reputed witch in
Cornaig, Tiree, found two churns full of water on the
floor and a shallow milk-dish (<i>measair</i>) full of butter
on the table.</p>

<p>In olden times the master of a ship, dining with the
Laird of Coll, was asked if the butter on the table was
not very fine. He said it was for pig’s butter. The
dairymaid was called up and questioned. She confessed
that seeing a whale (<i>muc-mhara</i>, lit. sea-pig)
passing, and hearing its bellow (<i>geumraich</i>), she had
taken the substance (<i>toradh</i>) of its milk from it. If
the laird believed her, he was an honest, unsuspicious
man, who never dreamt of any collusion between her
and his guest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>A Tiree witch once took all their milk from the
Laird of Coll’s cows, and was on her way home with
it in a <i>duitheaman</i>, a black seaweed not unlike a tangle,
wrapped round her body. A man met her, cut the
black tangle with his knife, and all the milk flowed out
on the ground. Witches also carried away milk in
needles, dung-forks, etc., and have been detected taking
it in a stream from the chimney crook. A sailor,
whose ship was on her way through the Kyles of Bute
(<i>na caoil Bhòdach</i>), hearing a bull roaring on the Cowal
coast, took the milk from the herd of which it was lord
by cutting the cable with an axe. The milk came
streaming from the cable.</p>

<p>It is related of ‘Mr. Lachlan,’ a former minister of
Kintail, that going one day to the house of a reputed
witch, without telling who he was, he induced her, as a
specimen of her power, to milk the chimney crook.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
The cow from which the milk was to be taken was the
minister’s own. The witch went to work, till all the
milk was extracted, and then asked the minister if he
was satisfied. He told her to go on, and she milked
the iron till blood came. When the minister went
home he found his cow dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>A witch in Lochaber had a little pet sheep, by milking
which she gathered to herself the milk from the
flocks of all the neighbouring farmers.</p>

<p>Hairy Donald (Dò’ull Molach), a Morven celebrity
of last century, professing great skill in healing or
hurting cattle by means of magic charms, was laughed
at for his pretensions by the parish minister, and his
powers were made game of. Donald, at his own
request, was shut up in a room, and a particular cow
was named by the minister for him to exercise his
talents upon. Before he finished his incantations the
cow fell over the rocks.</p>

<p>A man bought at a market from a stranger a mart
or winter cow. When killing it, the blows of the axe
made no impression. An old man who came the way,
when told of this, examined the cow’s tail, and found a
<i>red string</i> tied round it. On this being taken away,
the cow fell at the first blow.</p>

<h3>COUNTER-CHARMS.</h3>

<p>Of course the spells of witches could be counteracted.
It would not be right that such dangerous
powers should be unchecked. Some of the counter-charms
were good disinfectants, but in general the
efficacy of the remedy was as imaginary as the enemy
whose machinations were to be defeated. It was to
prevent the taking of milk from cows that nearly all the
counter-charms were used. Anything in which people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
believed would be sufficient, but the antidotes in
ordinary use were these.</p>

<p><i>Juniper</i> (<i>Iubhar-beinne</i>, <i>aiteal</i>), pulled in a particular
manner, was burned before the cattle and put in cows’
tails.</p>

<p>A ball of hair (<i>gaoisid</i>), called a <i>Ronag</i>, was put in
the milk-pail on Lammas-day or on the Thursday
after, to keep its substance in the milk during the rest
of the year. MacSymon (<i>Mac-Shiomoun</i>, a sept of
MacArthurs), a native of Balemartin, Tiree, was much
resorted to in former times for these constitution balls.
On Lammas-day (<i>Lùnasdal</i>) he gave to all who came
to him a little bag of plants, sewn up, to be placed in
the cream jug (<i>croggan uachdair</i>) for the ensuing year,
that the cattle and the milk might retain their virtue or
substance (<i>toradh</i>).</p>

<p>Stale urine (<i>maistir</i>) should be sprinkled on the
door-posts and about the byre. It keeps away the
evil eye. There was an old woman in Coll who was
taken notice of by her neighbours for sprinkling cows
and door-posts every night. Her intention no doubt
was to make assurance doubly sure.</p>

<p>The mountain ash (<i>Caorrunn</i>) was the most powerful
charm of any.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“A Rowan-tree and a red thread</div>
<div class="verse">Gars a’ the witches dance to dead.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Its efficacy was known in England as well as in the
Highlands. The peg of the cow-shackle (<i>Cnag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
chaorruinn sa bhuaraich</i>) should be made of it, as well
as the handle and cross (<i>crois na loinid</i>) of the churn<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
staff. In Islay, not twenty years ago, a man had a
rowan-tree collar for securing his cow at night, and
every time the animal visited the bull he passed this
collar thrice through the chimney crook. On Beltane-day
annually he dressed all the houses with rowan.
It was said of the man in Craignish who gathered
potent herbs on St. Swithin’s day and studied magic
with one foot in the chimney crook:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A <i>horse-shoe</i> was of great power for the protection
of cattle against witchcraft. As in England, it must
be found by accident. It was put above the byre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
door, and a nail from it driven into the lowest hoop
(<i>cearcal</i>) of the milk-dish (<i>mias</i>) kept its substance in
the milk. It preserved horses when put above the
stable door, and ships when nailed to the mast. An
entire horse could not be touched by evil spirits, and
its rider was safe from the attacks of witchcraft. A
person in the neighbourhood of Luing, Argyllshire,
returning from a funeral, found himself unable to make
any progress on his road home, though he did his
utmost all night to get on. He was retarded by some
unseen influence. He rode an entire horse, and found
himself safe at daybreak. His safety lay in the horse
he rode. The famed <i>Red Book of Appin</i>, according
to one version of the tale, was got by one who rode an
entire horse to a meeting of witches, and, having got
hold of the book, made off with it in despite of the
devil and all his servants. In a West Highland tale
(ii., 87), the owner of the <i>Red Book</i> advises the shoe
of an entire horse to be nailed on the byre door, to
counteract the witches, who were taking the milk
from the cows. The shoes of entire horses probably
are the proper kind to use, though others came into
use from being found equally efficacious.</p>

<p><i>Tar</i>, put on the door, kept witches away, and put
on the cow’s ear, was believed to prevent <i>ceathramh
gorm</i>, or quarter ill.</p>

<p>If, notwithstanding all these safeguards, or through
neglect of them, a cow lost its milk, or the milk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
ceased to yield butter or cream, there were several
methods by which the witchcraft, which was undoubtedly
the cause, might be counteracted. Some
of these remedies appear more like the inventions of
practical jokers than ceremonies from which any
rational meaning can be taken.</p>

<p>When a cow ceases unaccountably to give milk,
and witchcraft is suspected, its owner is to take some
of the animal’s urine (<i>maistir</i>), put it in a bottle, and
cork it well. The witch who has taken the milk
cannot make a drop of water till the milk is allowed
to come back. It is a common story that the owner
of bewitched cows, under the advice of ‘wise’ people
of his neighbourhood, put a potful of the cows’ dung
on the fire, and boiled it. He then put in half an
ounce of pins and stirred the compost, till at last the
witch appeared at the hole which formed the window,
and entreated him to stop tormenting her, and all
would be well. He stopped, and next morning his
cows had milk as usual. It was also said that by
putting pins in the cow’s milk, and boiling till the
dish is dry, the witch is made to appear and confess.
A woman once did this in Tiree, and found her own
brother was the guilty party. Old people in the
east side of Skye remember the bull being put on
the top of a suspected witch’s house to bring back
their milk to a farmer’s cows. The more brutal method
of <i>scoring</i>, or drawing blood from, the witch above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
her breath—the object of which could only be to
make clowns strike poor old women on the face with
their fists—was unknown in the Highlands. The plant
<i>mōthan</i>, pearlwort, put in the milk-pail, was a more
gentle but quite as sure a method of restoring its
virtue to the milk. If a piece of it was in the bull’s
hoof at the time of pairing no witch could touch
the offspring’s milk.</p>

<p>In Tiree a person lost several stirks by the stakes
falling and strangling them in the byre. A ‘wise’
woman, reputed a witch, advised, though her advice
was not taken, that the <i>right hand part of a fore
horse-shoe, with three nails in it</i>, should be put below
the threshold (<i>stairsneach</i>) of the byre, along with a
silver coin, and that the hind quarter of one of the
beasts should be taken <i>west</i> and buried beyond the
limits of the farm. This was to prevent a similar
calamity in future.</p>

<h3>GOING TO SEA.</h3>

<p>The Lewis witches were accounted the best for
raising wind. A large number of them were at one
time destroyed in the following manner. A tailor,
working in a farmer’s house, where there happened
at the time to be a scarcity of seasoning for dinner
(<i>gann-do-dh’annlan</i>), was told by the farmer’s wife,
this would not be the case to-morrow, if he could
get breakfast past without the goodman saying grace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
The tailor managed this, and his curiosity being
roused, remained awake the following night, to see
what the wife would do. He saw a number of
women, among whom he recognised his own wife,
assembling in the farm-house and accompanied by
the farmer’s wife, disappearing up the chimney, each
in a wicker creel. In the morning the farmer’s
wife came back with her creel full of fresh herring.
The tailor, when he went home, strongly represented
to his wife the propriety of allowing him to accompany
the witches in their future fishing expeditions.
Two shares of the fish would then fall to them
instead of one. The proposal was laid before a
meeting of the witches, and in the circumstances
they consented. To the number of eighteen the
witches went to sea on a line of worsted thread,
the tailor’s wife being left ashore to hold the
ball, or end of the line, in her hand. The tailor
persuaded her to go with the rest, and leave him in
charge of the line. She went and the tailor paid
out more line, till he thought the witches far enough
out at sea. He then cut the thread and allowed the
whole lot to drown.</p>

<p>Similarly, somewhere in the north (all marvels of
this kind are said in the south Highlands to have
occurred in the north) a tailor was working in the
house of an old woman, who knew the forbidden
arts, but at the time was short of <i>kitchen</i> for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
dinner. She took a creel, sat in it, and having
muttered some mystic words, disappeared through a
hole in the roof that formed the chimney. In a while
she came back with the creel full of herring. The
tailor kept the spell in remembrance, and the first
day he got the old woman out of the way, sat in
the creel, and repeated it. He does not seem, however,
to have learned the words quite correctly, for
the creel, instead of making for the hole in the roof,
rose straight up and hit his head violently against
the rafters. It then floated along against the roof,
as if in search of an outlet. It bumped his head a
second time against the rafters and he roared out,
“Where, in the curse of God, are you going now?”
Instantly at the name of the Deity, the creel fell
down, and the tailor dislocated his hips (<i>chaidh e as
a ghobhal</i>). He never again dabbled in the dark
science.</p>

<p>In Skye, one of a party of women, assembled at
an old woman’s house to full cloth, went by accident
into the barn, and found it full of fish suspended
from the roof. “There are many herrings here,” she
said; and there being no way by which the old
woman could have got them but by witchcraft, she
taxed her with unholy practices. The old woman
got very angry at the exposure.</p>

<p>A Barra and a Uist witch one year tried each
other’s powers in drawing the fish to their respective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
islands. The Barra witch proved the stronger, and
took the fish to Castlebay (<i>Bàgh Chìosamuill</i>).</p>

<p>Another year the Uist and Tiree witches had a
similar contest. The latter prevailed, and the men
of a bygone generation believed that every flounder
caught that year on the Tiree shores had a hole in
its tail, made by the witches in the struggle.</p>

<p>On the shallows (<i>oitir</i>) between Tiree and Coll, the
witches of the two islands were often seen fighting for
the flounders that abound in the locality. The appearance
that suggested the fancy was no doubt the same as
is still to be seen on these banks in stormy weather.</p>

<p>A witch, who left home every night, was followed
by her husband, who wondered what she could be
about. She became a cat, and went in the name of
the devil to sea in a sieve, with seven other cats.
The husband upset the sieve by naming the Trinity,
and the witches were drowned. So the Skye story
runs. In the Sound of Mull the witches went on
board the sieve, “against the name of the Father,
and the Son, and the Holy Ghost”; and the husband
upset the concern by putting his foot on board in the
name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy
Ghost. In Tiree the unfortunate women were passing
Kennavara hill in eggshells on their way to Ireland,
when the husband of one of them, seeing the fleet,
wished them God-speed. Instantly the eggshells
sank, and the women were drowned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<h3>RAISING STORMS AND DROWNING PEOPLE.</h3>

<p>The belief that witches can trouble the sea and
raise the wind is widespread, reaching even to the
native Africans. It is part of the regular traffic of
Finland witches to sell wind to mariners,—as in the
case of their Celtic sisters, tied in knots upon a thread.
The following story is common to many places.</p>

<p>A boatman from one of the southern islands was
long detained in Lewis by adverse winds. He was
courting a witch’s daughter, and applied to her mother
for a favourable wind. He gave her a pound of
tobacco, and, assisted by neighbouring witches, after
three days’ exertion, she produced a string with three
knots upon it. The first knot was called ‘Come
gently’ (<i>Thig gu fòill</i>), and when he loosened it, as
he left the shore, a gentle breeze sprang up. The
second knot was called ‘Come better’ (<i>Teann na’ s
fhèarr</i>), and on its being untied the breeze came
stiffer. As he neared the harbour, he out of curiosity
loosened the last knot, the name of which was ‘Hardship’
(<i>Cruaidh-chàs</i>). A wind came “to blow the
hillocks out of their places” (<i>séideadh nan cnoc</i>), and
sent the thatch of the houses into the furrows of
the plough-land, and the boatman was drowned. In
Harris, they say the boat was drawn up on land
and secured before the last knot was untied. She
was capsized and smashed to pieces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>The following, known as “Big Macmhuirich’s Supplication”
(<i>Achanaich Mhic Mhuirich Mhòir</i>), is another
form of the Celtic belief.</p>

<p>‘Macpherson of power’ (<i>Mac-Mhuirich nam buadh</i>),
a noted wizard in South Uist, was on a passage by
sea on a calm day. The skipper said to him, “Ask
for a wind, Mac-Vuirich.” He did so, saying:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“An east wind from the calm aether,</div>
<div class="verse">As the Lord of the elements has ordained,</div>
<div class="verse">A wind that needs not rowing nor reefing,</div>
<div class="verse">That will do nought deceitful to us.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">“Weak and trifling you have asked it,” said the
skipper, “when I myself am at the helm.” Mac-Vuirich
answered:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“A north wind hard as a rod,</div>
<div class="verse">Struggling above our gunwale,</div>
<div class="verse">Like a red roe sore pressed,</div>
<div class="verse">Descending a hillock’s narrow hard head.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">“It does not attain to praise yet,” said the skipper,
and Mac-Vuirich went on:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“If there be a wind in cold hell,</div>
<div class="verse">Devil; send it after us,</div>
<div class="verse">In waves and surges;</div>
<div class="verse">And if one go ashore, let it be I,</div>
<div class="verse">And if two, I and my dog.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">A sea came, that rolled the boat’s stern over her
bows, and all were drowned but Mac-Vuirich and his
dog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>The power of this wizard over the elements was also
shown on another occasion. The MacRanalds were
coming to attack the MacNeills of Barra, to whom
Mac-Vuirich was favourable. Their boat was seen
coming along the wild and rocky coast on the west of
Skye, and was sunk by the mighty wizard uttering the
following words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“A south-west wind toward Eiste point,</div>
<div class="verse">Mist and rain,</div>
<div class="verse">Clan Ranald on a breaking board,</div>
<div class="verse">I reck it not;</div>
<div class="verse">A narrow unsteady vessel,</div>
<div class="verse">A lofty pointed sail,</div>
<div class="verse">A lading of empty barrels,</div>
<div class="verse">And bilge-water to the thwarts,</div>
<div class="verse">A weak irascible crew</div>
<div class="verse">Having no respect one for another.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">As might be expected, such a boat did not go far
before sinking.</p>

<p>The usual way witches took to shipwreck a vessel
was to put a small round dish (<i>cuach</i>) floating in a
milk-pan (<i>measair</i>) placed on the floor full of water.
They then began their incantations, and when the dish
upset, the ship sank.</p>

<p>On one occasion three witches from Harris left home
at night after placing the milk-pan thus on the floor, in
charge of a servant-maid, who was straitly enjoined
not to let anything come near it. The girl’s attention
was, however, called away for a short time, and a duck
came in and took to squattering about in the water on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the floor. The witches on their return in the morning,
asked if anything had come near the milk-pan.
The girl said no, and one of them said, “What
a heavy sea we had last night coming round Càbag
head!”</p>

<p>A few years ago a boat was lost coming from Raasa
to Skye. The witches, who caused the calamity, were
seen at work in the Braes of Portree, beside a stream.
Three of them were engaged in the evil task, and a
man was present along with them. Jobs of the kind
require the presence of a man. A cockle-shell (<i>slige
coilleig</i>) was placed floating in a pool, and a number of
black stones were ranged round the edge of the pool.
When the incantation was at its height, the black
stones barked like dogs, and the cockle-shell disappeared.</p>

<p>A farmer in Mull and his little daughter were walking
along an eminence that overlooked the Sound,
through which a number of ships were passing at the
time. The little girl asked, “What will you give me,
father, if I sink all these ships?” Thinking she was in
fun, he asked her how she would do it. She stooped
down, and looked backwards between her legs at one
of the vessels. The ship whirled round and sank. In
this expeditious manner all the ships in sight were
sunk, but one. The man asked why this one did not
sink. The girl said it was because there was rowan-tree
wood on board, and she could not touch it. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
then asked who had taught her all this? She said it
was her mother. The man, who was a good man, and
before ignorant of his wife’s dabbling in witchcraft,
gathered his neighbours and burned herself and
daughter.</p>

<p>A witch was engaged to destroy a boat coming to
Tiree. Another witch, however, wished its safety. The
former came in shape of a gull, that hovered about the
boat, and kept it back (a head wind?). The other
came as a cormorant (<i>sgarbh</i>), followed in the wake of
the boat (<i>an uisge na stiùirceach</i>, lit. the waters of the
rudder), and saved it. (Favourable tide?)</p>

<p>A former Lord Macdonald (<i>Mà-Cònuill</i>) was on his
way by boat to Uist, and experienced very unfavourable
weather. When near his destination, a towering
wave, or, as it is called in Gaelic, ‘a drowning sea’
(<i>muir bhàite</i>), nearly overwhelmed the boat, and two
birds, a skua (<i>croma-ritheachar</i>) and an ordinary gull,
were observed fighting in the air. The one was
Yellow Claws, daughter of Donald, son of Cormac
(<i>spòga Buidhe ni’ a Dò’uill ’ic Cormaig</i>), the other Hump-backed
Blue-eye from Cràcaig (<i>Gorm-shùil chrotach a
Cràcaig</i>), both celebrated witches. The former was for
sinking the boat, the latter for saving it. Sometime
after Blue-eye met Lord Macdonald in Edinburgh, and
reminded him of the incident, and her own services on
the occasion. He just remarked, “There was indeed
such a circumstance.”</p>

<p>A ship, sailing from Greenock, was to be destroyed
by the Captain’s wife and two other witches. An
apprentice overheard them planning this, and saying
that they would come upon the ship on a certain
day as three rolling waves, and the ship would be
sunk, unless the waves were cut with a sword. At
the time said the apprentice was allowed the command
of the vessel, and standing in the bow with
a drawn sword, cleft the waves, and defeated the
witches.</p>

<p>A boat from Hianish, Tiree, went out fishing on the
day before the New Year. The morning was calm, but
when the boat was returning the wind rose and the
sea became very heavy. The best steersman in the
boat took the helm. Another, sitting on the hindmost
thwart (<i>tota shílidh</i>), after looking for a while towards
the stern, asked the helm from him, and being again
and again refused, at last took it by force. When he
got the rudder below his arm, he said, “Now, come
on!” and the boat reached shore in safety. He then
explained that he had been seeing a gull, unseen by
the first steersman, following the boat, and had recognised
her as a woman of the neighbourhood. This
woman had an illegitimate child by the first steersman,
and it was thought her object in raising the
storm and following so close in the wake of the
boat, was to snatch her seducer with her and drown
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Ian Garve (stout John), laird of Raasa (<i>Iain Garbh
Mac-ille-Challum Ratharsa</i>), a man celebrated in Highland
song and legend for his great personal strength,
was drowned by a witch who had this mysterious
power of raising storms. The event occurred on
Easter Monday (<i>Di-luain Càisge</i>), in the great ‘storm
of the Borrowing Days,’ of which a contemporary
historian says “the like of this tempest was not
seen in our time, nor the like of it heard in this
country in any age preceding,” <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1625; yet the
traditions of the event are still fresh in popular memory.
The witch was Ian Garve’s own foster-mother (<i>muime</i>),
and resided on the islet of Trodda (<i>Trodaidh</i>), on the
east of Skye. She overheard a friend of hers say he
wished Ian Garve, who was known to have gone to the
Lewis, was drowned, and took up seriously words
spoken only in jest. Others say she was bribed by
an enemy to effect the hero’s destruction. He left
Loch Sealg in Lewis to proceed home on a calm day.
The witch was dairymaid (<i>banachag</i>) in Trodda, and,
seeing the boat coming, put milk in a large dish, and a
small empty dish floating in it. A boy was placed
standing in the doorway, where he could see both the
milk-pan and Ian Garve’s boat. She herself stood
with her foot in the ‘swey’ or chimney crook, and
began her unholy incantations. Soon the dish in the
milk-pail began to be violently agitated. The boy
reported it first as going round sunwise (<i>deiseal</i>), then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
as going round against the sun and striking the sides
of the basin, and finally as being capsized and floating
bottom upwards (<i>air a bial foidhpe</i>). The storm had
been all this time increasing, till at last it blew a perfect
hurricane. That night the heap of shingle on
East-side (<i>Du-sear</i>), called <i>Moll-stabhan</i>, was washed
ashore. Ian Garve’s boat disappeared simultaneously
with the capsizing of the bowl, and all on board
perished. Three ravens hovered about the boat as
the storm was rising, and it became afterwards known
that these three were Yellow Claws (<i>Spòga Buidhe</i>)
from Màiligeir on East-side, Hump-backed Blue-eye
(<i>Gorm-shùil chrotach</i>) from Cràcaig near Portree, and
Doideag from Mull. When the boat was between
Bare Skerries (<i>Sgeire maola</i>) and Trodda twenty birds
flew about, and some of them assumed the shape of
frogs (<i>muileacha màg</i>) on the deck. All the witches in
Scotland were there, but were unable to sink the boat
till Ian Garve said to the frogs, “What the brindled
one has brought you here?”<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> After that he became
distracted from the number of birds and frogs coming
upon him. A raven lighted on the gunwale of the
boat, and Ian Garve, striking at it with his sword, cleft
the boat to the water’s edge. The first news of the
drowning was heard on Minigeig Hill (<i>Monadh mhinigeig</i>)
in Badenoch, and the particulars became known
by the telling of other witches. Another account says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the hero appeared that night to his wife in her dreams,
and said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“On Monday the wind arose,</div>
<div class="verse">And gathered its fury and rage;</div>
<div class="verse">Tell the mother of my body</div>
<div class="verse">’Twas the evils made the hunt.”<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The shade came thrice and repeated this. Next
day the wife told the dream to her mother-in-law, who
exclaimed, “Then my beloved is lost” (<i>tha mo laogh-sa
caillte</i>).</p>

<p>By far the most celebrated tale of this class is that
of the destruction of Captain Forrest’s ship by witches
in the Sound of Mull.</p>

<p>Viola (<i>Bheòla</i>), daughter of the King of Spain,
dreamt of a remarkably handsome man, and made a
vow not to rest till she found him. She fitted out a
boat, and in the course of her wanderings came to
Tobermory Bay. Here she saw MacLean of Dowart,
who proved to be the man she was in search of, and,
though he was a married man, became too intimate
with him. MacLean’s wife in her jealousy caused her
servant Smollett, a south countryman, to blow up the
ship with all on board. After setting fire to a fuse
leading to the magazine, Smollett made his escape, and
by the time the explosion took place reached Pennygown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
a distance of ten or twelve miles. The cook was
blown to Srongarve (<i>sròn-garbh</i>, rough nose), near
Tobermory, where there is a cleft still bearing the
name of the Cook’s Cave (<i>Uamh Chòcaire</i>). The
Princess herself fell somewhere in the sound, and was
buried at <i>Cill</i>, the Loch Aline burying-ground in Morven.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
Upon the news of the dreadful event reaching
Spain, Captain Forrest (whose name is not very Spanish)
was sent with a ship to take vengeance upon the Mull
people by taking off the right breast of every Mull
woman. When the ship came the Lady of Dowart
sent for <i>Doideag</i>, the Mull witch, and by her means,
with assistance procured from neighbouring witches,
Captain Forrest’s ship was sunk before next morning.
Doideag shut herself up in a house alone at Guirman
Point (<i>Rutha Ghuirmein</i>), near Dowart, and there made
her incantations. A rope was put through a hole in a
rafter, and all night long the handmill (<i>brà</i>) was hoisted
up to the beam, lowered, and hoisted again. A native
of Tiree reported that, having come that evening to
Doideag’s house, he was compelled by her to hoist and
lower and hoist the mill-stone all night without rest or
refreshment, while the witch herself went away to Tiree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and elsewhere for help. On her return she said that
when in Tiree she had been detained a little in extinguishing
a fire, which had been caused by a spark
falling among the fodder in the stirk-house belonging
to the man who was her unwilling assistant. As the
quern was raised a gale sprang up, and increased in
fury as the operation went on. At the same time gulls
(others say hooded-crows, others black cats) appeared
on the yard-arms of the devoted ship. Captain Forrest
knew the Black Art himself, and went below. As
word was brought him that another gull had appeared
in the rigging, he said, “I will suffice for this one yet”
(<i>Fòghnaidh mi fhìn dhi so fhathast</i>). He could keep
the ship against some say eight, others nine, witches,
but “ere a’ the play was play’d” there were sixteen,
some say eighteen, on the yards. Their names depend
on the fancy of the narrator. All the Mull witches
(<i>na doideagun Muileach</i>) were there, and the most
powerful of the sisterhood from the surrounding districts.
<i>Nic-ill’-Domhnuich</i> from Tiree is commonly
mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> All accounts agree that when Big Blue-eye
from Mey (<i>Gorm-shùil Mhòr bha sa Mheigh</i>), the
powerful Lochaber witch, came, the ship sank. Shortly
before this Captain Forrest told a sailor to look up and
see how many gulls were on the yards (<i>seall suas co<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
miad faoileann air an t-shlait</i>). On being told eighteen,
he said, “We are lost.” In the morning Doideag was
told her house had been unroofed in the gale, but she
was comforted by being told the dreaded ship had gone
down opposite Coire-na-theanchoir Bay. “If you are
without a house, Captain Forrest is without a ship”
(<i>ma tha thusa gun tigh, tha Captain Forrest gun long</i>).</p>

<h3>WITCHES AS SHEEP.</h3>

<p>A native of Tiree was on his way home to the west
end of the island in the evening with a new gun in
his hand. When above the beach called Travay, he
observed a black sheep running towards him from
across the plain of Reef. Alarmed by the animal’s
motions, he put a silver sixpence in the gun, and on
its coming near enough, took aim. The black sheep
instantly became a woman, whom he recognised, with
a drugget coat wrapped about her head. The same
woman had often persecuted him before, particularly in
shape of a cat. She asked him to keep her secret, and
he promised to do so, but one day, when drunk in the
village to which the woman belonged, he told his
adventure and the name of the woman. In less than a
fortnight after he was drowned, and the witch (for such
the woman was universally reputed to be) was blamed
as the cause.</p>

<p>Hector M’Lean, in Coll, according to his own
account, was coming in the evening from Arinagour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
to Breacacha, a distance of four miles along what was
then throughout the greater part a mountain track.
When halfway, at Airidh-mhic-mharoich, a black sheep
came about his feet, and several times threw him down.
At last he took out a clasp-knife (<i>sgian-lughaidh</i>), and
threatened the sheep, if it came near him again, to
stick it with the knife. It, however, again and again
came and threw him down. In endeavouring to stab
it, the knife closed upon his own hand between the
finger and thumb, and cut him severely. On coming
to the large open drain or stream below Breacacha
Garden, he stood afraid to jump across, in case the
black sheep should come about his legs, and make him
fall in the drain. He was now, however, within hail of
his own house, and whistled loudly for his dog. It
came, and was fiercely hounded by him at the sheep.
Every time the dog made a rush and came too near,
the sheep became an old woman, whom Hector recognised
as one of his acquaintances, and jumped in the
air. She asked him to call off his dog, and he refused.
She asked him again, and promised, if he would do so,
to befriend him in right and wrong (<i>an còir’s an eucoir</i>).
At last he did call the dog, but it would not obey.
He caught it by the back of the neck, and it tried to
turn upon himself. He promised to keep his hold till
the woman made her escape. The witch became a
hare, and Hector called out to her, as she seemed to
have such wonderful power, to “add another leg to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
stern, to make her escape the faster.” When she was
some distance away, he let go the dog, and went home.
The dog did not come home till the following afternoon;
it followed the hare, compelled it to take refuge
on a shelf of rock (<i>uirigh creige</i>), and lay below on the
watch, till forced by hunger to go home. The woman
upbraided Hector, the first time she met him, for letting
go the dog. Afterwards, when he went as servant-man
to Arileod farm (<i>aìridh-Leoìd</i>) in the neighbourhood,
the same woman was often seen by him, in the shape
of a hare, sucking the cows. His dog, whenever it
caught sight of her, gave chase, and compelled her to
resume her proper shape. When he left the farm, she
was not seen there for some days. He went in search
of her, and accused her to her face of having been the
party that troubled the farm. She got into a rage,
and said she would punish him for raising such a story
about her. He answered that the proprietor of the
island had offered a reward for the discovery of the
guilty person, and if all the women in Coll were
gathered on one hillock his speckled dog (<i>cu breac</i>)
would pick her out as the offender. To this she made
no reply. He asked her to go to Arileod dairy that
night, so that people would not have it to say it was
for him the evil had arisen. She said this was
<i>Wednesday</i> night, and it was out of her power to do
anything, but the following night she would go, and he
would hear of it. On Thursday night she loosened the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
cows in Arileod byre, let in the calves, and did much
mischief.</p>

<h3>WITCHES AS HARES.</h3>

<p>In addition to the above tales, in which this transformation
has been mentioned, the following may be
given as further illustrations of the superstition.</p>

<p>A young man, in the island of Lismore, was out
shooting. When near Balnagown Loch, he started a
hare, and fired at it. The animal gave an unearthly
scream, and it then for the first time occurred to the
young man that there were no hares in Lismore. He
threw away his gun in terror, and fled home. Next
day he came back for the gun, and heard that a
reputed witch of the neighbourhood was laid up with
a broken leg. Ever after the figure of this woman
encountered him and gave him severe thrashings. This
preyed on his mind, and he never came to any good.
He proved brooding, idle, and useless.</p>

<p>A Manxman, who was in Tiree a few years ago, told
the following story. A party of sportsmen, engaged in
coursing, were at a loss for a hare. An old woman
told her grandson to go to them, tell them they would
get a hare at a certain spot, and get half-a-crown for
himself. The boy went, got his half-crown, and guided
the sportsmen to the spot his grandmother had indicated.
When the hare started he cried, “Run,
granny, run!” The hare made straight for the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
woman’s house, the dogs lost sight of it at the back of
the house, and the old woman was found sitting at the
fireside.</p>

<p>In Wigtonshire a hare ran up the chimney, and a
suspected witch near hand was found with burnt feet.</p>

<h3>WITCHES AS CATS.</h3>

<p>The association of witches with cats is of great
antiquity. In the legends of Greece and Rome, we are
told of a woman, who had been changed into a cat,
being chosen as priestess by Hecate, the goddess of
sorcery and magic power, and of Hecate herself, when
the gods were forced to hide themselves in animals,
taking refuge in the shape of a cat. The association
probably arose not so much from cats being the frequent,
almost invariable, companions of the poor old
women accused of witchcraft, as from the savage
character of the animal itself. Its noiseless and
stealthy motions, its persevering watchfulness, its extraordinary
agility and tenacity of life, its diabolical
caterwauling, prowling habits, deceitful spring, and the
luminous appearance of its eyes in the dark, would
alone suffice to procure it the name of unearthly; but
when infuriated, glaring, bristling, and spitting, it forms
a vivid representation of a perfect demon. In the
Highlands, it was not, as in the witchcraft of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, looked upon
as the familiar or attendant imp of the witch, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
merely as an animal, whose form witches frequently
assumed.</p>

<p>There were other superstitions connected with the
animal. Were it not the fear of being swallowed by
the ground, a cat would run much faster than it does.
When people have a cat along with them in a boat,
they cannot, or will not, be drowned by witches. By
burying a cat alive, people waiting for a favourable
wind get a breeze from the direction in which its head
is put; and a witch, that is, a young one, who is
courted by a sailor, can detain him with contrary winds
as long as she likes by shutting up the cat in the
cupboard. A cat scraping is a sign that some beast,
horse, cow, pig, or dog will be found dead on the farm
before long. A cat washing its face portends rain
next day, and turning its back to the fire storm and
rain. When removing from one house to another
(<i>imrich</i>), it is unlucky to take a cat. The animal
was disliked by the MacGregors, and the Camerons
of Glenevis could not tolerate it at all.</p>

<p>A shepherd in Kintail, living alone in a bothy, far
from other houses, after kindling in the evening a
bright cheerful fire, threw himself on a heather bed on
the opposite side of the house. About twenty cats
entered and sat round the fire, holding up their paws
and warming themselves. One went to the window,
put a black cap on its head, cried “Hurrah for
London!” and vanished. The other cats, one by one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
did the same. The cap of the last fell off, and the
shepherd caught it, put it on his own head, cried
“Hurrah for London!” and followed. He reached
London in a twinkling, and with his companions went
to drink wine in a cellar. He got drunk and fell
asleep. In the morning he was caught, taken before a
judge, and sentenced to be hanged. At the gallows
he entreated to be allowed to wear the cap he had on
in the cellar; it was a present from his mother, and he
would like to die with it on. When it came the rope
was round his neck. He clapped the cap on his head,
and cried “Hurrah for Kintail!” He disappeared
with the gallows about his neck, and his friends
in Kintail, having by this time missed him, and
being assembled in the bothy prior to searching
the hills, were much surprised at his strange appearance.</p>

<p>This is a fair specimen of the popular tale. It forms
the foundation of the Ettrick Shepherd’s “Witch of
Fife.” In Skye, the adventure was claimed by a man
nicknamed ‘Topsy-turvy’ (<i>But-ar-scionn</i>) as having
occurred to himself. After coming home, he made the
gallows into a weaver’s loom. The hero in Argyllshire
made it the stern and keel of a boat, which may be
seen in Lorn to this day. In Harris the hero is a
tailor: and the tale has been even found in the
Monach isles, west of Uist.</p>

<p>Captain Burt (1730) tells a story of a similar kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
which he had heard from a minister. A laird, whose
wine was disappearing mysteriously, suspecting witches
one night, when he thought the plunderers were at
work, entered the cellar, closed the door, and laid about
him with a broadsword. When light was brought, the
cats, whose eyes he had seen glaring at him in the
dark, disappeared, and only some blood was found on
the floor. An old woman in the neighbourhood, suspected
of being a witch, was found, on her house being
entered, in bed, with her leg cut off and lying below
the bed. The same story is told of the witches of
Thurso (<i>Inbher-Eòrsa</i>).</p>

<p>A tailor, named Macilduinn, was left in a house
alone on Hallowe’en night, while the rest of the household
went to a neighbour’s house to hold the festivities
of the evening. As he sat on a bed, working at his
trade, a great many cats came in, and attacking a bag
of flesh at the end of the bed soon tore it up and
devoured it. They then gathered round the tailor.
One said, “The back of my paw to Macilduinn!”
Another said, “The front of my paw to Macilduinn!”<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
These threats were repeated by all the rest, while they
held out their horrid claws, some derisively, some
menacingly, to the poor tailor. Frightened from his
wits, he blew out the light, sprung to the door, and
took to his heels. The cats gave chase, and by the
time he reached a neighbours house his back was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
scratched into shreds and thongs (<i>na iallun</i>) by the
claws of the infernal cats.</p>

<p>Cameron of Doïni, or Glenevis, was out hunting, and
killed a wild-cat. The animal, when expiring, asked
him to tell, when he went home, that ‘the King of the
Cats’ (<i>Righ nan Cat</i>) was dead, or according to others
‘the Key of Battle’ (<i>an Iuchair Chath</i>), or ‘the streaked
Brindled one’ (<i>a Bhruchail Bhreac</i>). As he told his
story, the little black kitten in the ash-hole (<i>an toll na
luath</i>) bristled up and swelled, till it was as large as a
dog. Cameron said, “You are swelling, cat.” The
cat answered, “My feathers and my swellings are
growing bigger with the heat,”<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and, springing at the
chieftain’s throat, killed him. The scions of this
family (<i>Teaghlach Dhomhainnidh no Ghlinn-Ibheis</i>) till
quite recent times, would not tolerate a cat in the house,
from the memory of this tradition.</p>

<p>The same story is told in the following manner,
without any locality being assigned for the incident.
A hunter killed a wild-cat, and when he came home
told his adventure. He said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“To-night has well prospered with us,</div>
<div class="verse">The big urchal-erchal has been slain.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">A kitten that was listening rose and said, “Has Bald
Entrails of the Cats been killed? If it were not the
many nights I have got meat and milk in your family,
I would have your long brindled weasand in my claws.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Tell Streaked Foul-Face, that Bladrum is dead,”<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and
saying this the kitten went away, and was never seen
afterwards.</p>

<p>Near Vaul in Tiree, a man riding home at night,
with his son, a young boy, seated behind him, was met
by a number of cats. The boy had his hands clasped
round his father, and the man, pressing them to his
sides, to make surer of the boy’s hold, urged his horse
to its speed. The cats sprang, and, fastening on the
boy, literally devoured him. When the man reached
home, with his horse at full gallop, he had only the
boy’s arms left.</p>

<p>A Wexford legend of the same kind (the two stories
might have been originally identical), said to be at
least as old as 1584, will be found in the <i>Dublin
University Magazine</i> for September, 1869.</p>

<p>A woman detected a strange cat drinking the milk in
her kirn, caught it by the back of the neck, and rapped
its nose against the floor. It went about mewing in a
melancholy manner, till the woman took pity on it,
and called it, saying, “Puss, puss, till you get a drop”
(<i>Puis, puis, gus am faigheadh tu diar</i>). The cat
answered, “It is not a drop I want, but the way my
mouth is, Mary” (<i>Cha-ne diar tha mi’g iarraidh ach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
mar tha mo bhial a Mhàiri</i>). It then went away, but
came back through the night with two other cats.
One said they would take the back of their paws to
the woman, but the second said the front of their
paws. This resolution was carried by the casting vote
of the injured cat, and the woman was torn in shreds.</p>

<p>A man, going in the evening to see a girl he was
courting, was met at a lonely part of the road (near
the end of Balefetrish Hill in Tiree) by seven cats, and
was so terrified that he turned back and thereby lost his
sweetheart. She married an old man from the village
of Hianish, where a noted witch dwelt. The old man
got the blame of bribing the witch to send the cats.</p>

<p>In olden times a cat belonging to the tenant of
Heynish in Tiree was much addicted, like the rest of its
kind, to stealing cheese. It was caught in the act, and,
as a punishment for the past and a lesson for the
future, its ears were taken off. The tenant had occasion
to go from home, and on his return found the cat
lying dead, having been hung for theft in his absence.
He took it in his lap, and thus addressed it:</p>

<p>A Tiree boat was tacking out of a loch in the
north. A man met it at a point of land near which
it came, and asked to be taken to the other side.
One of the boatmen was willing, but the rest were
not, as they would thereby lose time. Next tack
back, the man met the boat again, with the same
result. “Well, then,” he said, “perhaps you will
repent it.” At the mouth of the loch the boatmen
heard a howling as of innumerable cats. A storm
arose, and with difficulty they reached shelter at the
island of Eigg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<h3>WITCHES AS RATS.</h3>

<p>A Tiree boatman, bringing a load of peats from
the Ross of Mull, was met at the Treshinish Isles
by two rats sailing along on dry cowsherds. As good
luck did not direct him, he threw a piece of peat at
the rats, and upset their frail barks. A storm sprang
up, and with difficulty he got to land. The rats
were witches, and he should not have meddled with
them.</p>

<h3>WITCHES AS GULLS.</h3>

<p>A witch assumed the shape of a gull, delighting
in storms, not only to bring danger or safety to a
boat, as already told, but also for payment to bring
back news of fishing boats driven away in a storm.</p>

<p>A boat from Tiree, going for a cargo of wood,
was caught in a violent gale and driven north past
Ardnamurchan Point. With difficulty the boatmen,
four in number, secured her in a creek. They remained
in a cave for four days, till the storm abated.
The suddenness and violence of the gale caused much
anxiety to their friends, and two women, one of whom
had two sons and a son-in-law in the boat, and the
other, a widow, her youngest and only surviving son,
consulted a famous witch, <i>Nic-ill’-Dòmhnuich</i>, in Caolas,
as to their fate. The witch told them to come next
day, and she would tell them. Early next morning
the widow went. “Yea,” said the witch, “they live,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and they had no little amusement last night fighting
for the <i>Fallaid</i> bannock, and your son had his own
share of it.” When the young men came home,
they were questioned as to their seeing anything the
night the witch was sent for news. They said a
grey gull was seen by them sitting on the edge of
the rocks that overhang their place of shelter and
peering down at them. One was for throwing stones
at it, but the rest dissuaded him. It was only seen
that night and next morning.</p>

<h3>WITCH AS CORMORANT.</h3>

<p>A man named Campbell, in the Long Island, as
the outer Hebrides are called, had two sweethearts,
for one of whom he did not very much care. They
were both to be present at a gathering of women
for fulling cloth, and he resolved to go and see them.
When he arrived he found only the one he least
liked. He left shortly, and set off to where the
other was. On the way he had to cross a ford on
large stepping-stones. As he was doing so a cormorant
(<i>sgarbh</i>) came, and splashed him fiercely with
water. He had a cudgel in his hand, and gave the
strange bird a whack on the back. He then passed
on, and the distance being considerable did not return
till next day. When returning he had to pass the
house of the slighted damsel. Her mother met him
at the door, and said, she could not understand what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
was wrong with her daughter; she had got suddenly
ill last night, and was very bad with a sore back.
Campbell said he knew the reason, and would have
nothing further to say to her daughter. The woman
then threatened him, but no evil ever came of her
threat.</p>

<h3>WITCHES AS WHALES.</h3>

<p>A Skye fisherman gave the following narrative of
witchcraft to which he himself was a witness. He
and his brother were at the herring fishing in Portree
in his native isle, and during that season out of all
the herring boats one only was successful. It had
only a crew of two, and every night caught from
eight to ten crans of fish. The other boats were
empty or nearly so. One night when the nets were
set, the boat, in which he and his brother were, sprang
a leak, and was taken back to the harbour and
beached. The rest of the crew went away to the
village, but he remained till the boat was left dry
by the receding tide. In a while he also left, and
as he did so, saw a young girl coming out of a
house and tapping at a neighbour’s window. Another
girl came out of that house, and wondering what the
two could be about at that hour of the night, he
followed them from the village. On reaching the
green, the two girls began to disport themselves
(<i>braise</i>), then of a sudden became hares, and chased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
each other round and round. After this they made
their way to the shore, and at the edge of the water
(<i>gob na tuinne</i>), leapt into the sea and became whales.
They went out from land spouting the water as high
as a ship’s mast. Next morning the boats came in
empty. The fishermen said they had seen during
the night two whales throwing up the sea in a dreadful
manner (<i>smùideadh na fairge gu h-eagallach</i>), which
made them think there was fish in the neighbourhood.
The lucky boat was full as usual.</p>

<p>The meaning of this tale seems to be that the
man had been listening the night before to tales of
witchcraft, had fallen asleep in the boat on the beach,
and had a troublous dream.</p>

<h3>DELAYING THE BIRTH OF A CHILD.</h3>

<p>This infernal cantrip was played by means of a ball
of black worsted thread in a black bag, kept at the foot
of the witch’s weaving loom, where it might not be
detected. If the ball was taken away the plot fell
through. In proof of this, there is a story told that a
child was once kept twenty-two years in its mother’s
womb by means of witches, and when born it had hair,
beard, and teeth, like a person of that age.</p>

<p>The mother of a celebrated West Highland freebooter,
‘Allan of the Faggots’ (<i>Ailein nan sop</i>), was a
servant maid who became pregnant by a married man.
The man’s wife, when she heard of the scandal, got a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
<i>bone</i> from a witch, which, she was assured, would, as
long as it was kept, delay the birth of the child.
Allan of the Faggots was thus kept in his mother’s
womb for fifteen months beyond the usual time. The
husband got word of his wife’s doings, and took a plan
to defeat her. He made his Fool one day come
home, pretending to be very drunk, staggering about,
and smashing the furniture. On being called to task,
the Fool said he had been in a house down yonder
(that of the servant-maid), where a child had at last
been born, and had got a dram, which went into his
head. The wife, on hearing this, thought the witch
had deceived her, and threw the bone into the fire. It
disappeared in blue smoke, and knocked down the
chimney! Allan was then born, with large teeth.</p>

<p>In other tales to the same effect, the trick usually
is played on a married woman, by the mother of a
maid who had been slighted on her account.</p>

<h3>CLAY CORPSE.</h3>

<p>The greatest evil that witches can do is to make, for
a person whose death they desire, a clay body or image
(<i>corp creadha</i>), into which pins are stuck, to produce a
slow and painful disease, terminating in dissolution.
Waxen figures for the same purpose, and melted by
exposure to a slow fire, were known to Lowland superstition.
In the Highlands wax was not accessible to
poor bodies, and they had to make clay serve the turn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
It is said that when a person wants a limb he cannot
be destroyed by witches in this manner.</p>

<p>MacIain Ghiarr, the Ardnamurchan thief, stole so
many cattle from MacLean of Dowart that he made
that chief his deadly enemy. On one of his roving
expeditions he was passing at midnight the chapel or
burying-ground of Pennygown (<i>caibeal Peighinn-a-ghobhan</i>),
on the Sound of Mull. Seeing a light in
the chapel, he entered, and found three witches sticking
pins in a clay body (<i>corp creadha</i>) intended to represent
MacLean of Dowart. As each pin was stuck in,
MacLean was seized with a stitch in the corresponding
part of his body. Only the last pin remained to
be stuck in. It was to be in the heart, and to cause
death. MacIain Ghiarr scattered the witches, took
with him the clay corpse, and made his way to MacLean,
whom he found at death’s door. He took out
in his presence the pins one by one, and when the last
was taken out MacLean jumped up a hale man, and
remained ever after the warm friend of MacIain Ghiarr.</p>

<p>MacGilvray, a former minister of Strathfillan, in
Perthshire, was seized with burning pains all over his
body, and was slowly wasting away by some malady,
of which the nature could not be understood. He
lived at Clachan in that strath, and one morning early
a woman from the opposite side of the river, on her
way to call and ask for him, saw another woman going
along before her, who had the reputation of being a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
witch. Wondering what her neighbour was about at
that early hour, she kept well behind and watched.
The foremost woman, on coming to a hollow, stooped
down, buried something in the ground, and then walked
on towards the minister’s house. The other came and
dug up what had been buried. It proved to be a piece
of wood stuck all over with pins. She took it with
her to the manse, and produced it, to the confusion of
the witch. On the pins being withdrawn the minister
was freed from his pains and got quite well again.</p>

<p>Ross-shire witches could not destroy ‘Donald of the
Ear’ (<i>Do’uill na Cluaise</i>), of whom they had made a
clay figure, from being unable to put on the ear.
Donald had lost the ear in battle. Similarly a <i>corp
creadha</i> made for Lord Macdonald by <i>Raonaid a
Chreagain</i> failed, because the witches never could put
the arm on.</p>

<p>Witches could also produce disease in other ways.
Thus, a young man in Perthshire—the tailor Cumming
in Drimachastle, Rannoch—fell into a decline. He
accounted himself for the loss of health, decay, and
sweats at night by witches coming at night when he
was in Badenoch (a district at the time celebrated for
witchcraft), and converting him into a horse, on which
they rode through the air to Edinburgh and other
places to spend the night carousing in well-stored
cellars. He now saw them often passing in different
shapes and in eggshells, etc. The poor young man did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
not understand the sweats of consumption, and his
imagination was disordered by the many tales of
witchcraft he had heard.</p>

<p>The same tale, of converting men into horses, is with
slight variations common. In Lorn, a woman came
night after night and shook a bridle at the son of a
neighbouring farmer. He immediately became a horse,
on which she rode to London, etc. A younger brother
exchanged beds with him, and when the witches were
carousing, secured the magic bridle, converted the witch
herself into a horse, rode home, and before taking off
the bridle took his horse to a smithy, and put on four
shoes. Next day an old woman of the neighbourhood
was found with her feet and hands horribly mangled.</p>

<h3>SILVER SIXPENCE.</h3>

<p>As already said, silver fired from a gun will wound
a witch, and force her to assume her proper shape.
An English sportsman, according to a Perthshire
version of an old story, was sitting surrounded by his
dogs, in a mountain bothy at the dead hour of night.
A cat came in, but the dogs did not move. It sat
with its back to the fire, and swelled till it was as large
as a yearling calf. The Englishman took a silver
button off his clothes, and putting it in the gun, fired
at the cat. The brute scampered out at the door.
On going to the strath next day, the sportsman being
a doctor, was sent for to see a farmer’s wife, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
got suddenly ill. He went, and extracted his own
silver button from her right breast.</p>

<h3>SAVING HORSES.</h3>

<p>In Uist, a band of horses wandered on to a ledge
in the face of a steep precipice. It was impossible to
take them from their dangerous position to the top of
the cliff by ropes, and to force them from the ledge to
the sea, which washed the base of the precipice, seemed
from the height of the fall, inevitable destruction. An
old man, who was reputed to know more than his
paternoster, advised, however, they should be driven
over, and himself began an incantation, beginning
“<i>Casa Gurra, Casa Gurra</i>,” whatever that may mean.
The horses of their own accord went over the ledge,
and swam safely to land.</p>

<h3>TAILOR AND WITCHES.</h3>

<p>A Glen-Quoich tailor, detected among a company of
witches, was asked what had brought him into such
society? He said it was “for the pleasure of the
company” (<i>mar shodan ris a chuideachd</i>).</p>

<h3>CELEBRATED WITCHES.</h3>

<p>The best-known names seem to have been merely
nicknames, given perhaps to more than one old woman.
‘Blue-eye’ (<i>Gorm-shùil</i>) is said to originate from the
witch having one eye black or brown and the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
blue. It is, however, a corruption of <i>Gormla</i>, an
ancient and pretty Gaelic name, usually rendered
Dorothy. <i>Gormla Mhòr</i> from Meigh, Lochaber, was
stronger than all the witches of Mull, and gave the
finishing stroke, as already detailed, to Capt. Forrest’s
ship. She met her death when astraddle on a mountain
stream, to intercept a salmon that had made its way up
to spawn. A large fish made a rush, knocked her
backwards in the water, and drowned her. There was
a Gormshuil in the village of Hianish, Tiree, a most
notorious local witch, and one in Cràcaig in Skye,
equally notorious. ‘Brindled-Headless-Stocking Foot’
(<i>Cas a mhogain riabhaich</i>) and ‘Rough Foot-gear, the
Herdsman’s daughter’ (<i>Caiseart gharbh ni’n an
Aodhair</i>) were anywhere but where the person who is
telling about them comes from himself. Shaw, the
Lochnell bard, makes them sisters dwelling in Glenforsa
in Mull, when Ossian was a little boy, and contemporaries
of Mac-Rùsluin. ‘Sallow Spot’ (<i>Ball
Odhar</i>) was from Kintra (<i>Ceann-trà</i>) in Ardnamurchan;
‘Yellow Claws’ (<i>Spòga buidhe</i>) from Maligeir on the
east side of Skye; <i>Doideag-un</i> is the well-known name
of the Mull witches, and is given by children to the
falling snowflakes, which they are informed are the
Mull witches on their journey through the air. Big
Kate MacIntyre in Fort-William was extensively
known some forty years ago as a person skilled in
divinations and possessing mysterious powers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<h3>WIZARD RISING AFTER DEATH.</h3>

<p>People who practised forbidden arts, as may readily
be supposed, did not rest after death. When buried
they remained quiet like other people, but till then
might be troublesome.</p>

<p>Among the hills of Ross-shire, an old man, who
in his time was not ‘canny,’ died in his son’s house,
a lonely hut in the hills remote from other houses.
He was stretched and adjusted (<i>air a ruidheadh ’s
air a chàradh</i>) on a board in a closet, and the shepherd,
leaving his wife and children in the house, went
to the strath for people to come to the wake and
funeral. At midnight, one of the children, playing
through the house, peeped in at the keyhole of the
closet and cried out, “Mother, mother! my grandfather
is rising.”<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The door of the closet was fast
locked, and the dead man, finding he could not open
it, began to scrape and dig the earth below it, to
make a passage for himself. The children gathered
round their mother, and in extremity of terror all
listened to the scraping of the unhallowed corpse.
At last the head appeared below the door, the corpse
increased its exertions, and the terror of the mother
and children became intense. The body was halfway
through below the door when the cock crew
and it fell powerless in the pit it had dug. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
pit could never afterwards be kept filled up to the
level of the rest of the floor.</p>

<p>In Tiree, a head-stone, placed at the grave of a
man whom report accused of dabbling in the dark
science, would not remain in its place till secured
by a chain. It fell every now and then out of its
position, but after the chain was fastened to it, it
remained firm, and is so now without the chain.</p>

<h3>HOW TO DETECT WITCHES.</h3>

<p>Early in the morning, on the first Monday of each
of the four quarters of the year, the smoke from a
witch’s house <i>goes against the wind</i>. This may be
seen by any one who takes the trouble of rising
early and going to an eminence, whence the witch’s
house can be seen.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="smaller">WHITE WITCHCRAFT.</span></h2>

<p>In English, a distinction is recognised between <i>black</i>
and <i>white</i> witches. The former could hurt but not help;
their power was only one of mischief. White witches
were honest, harmless practitioners of sorcery, “whom
our custom and country doth call wise men and wise
women.”<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> In Gaelic, there are no names corresponding
to Black and White Witches, but the distinction
indicated is well known. Those to whom the name
<i>Buidseach</i> (witch) properly applies could only do harm.
They raised storms, drowned people, took the milk
from cows, etc., etc. There were others who by magic
charms cured disease in man and beast, bestowed luck,
warded off dangers, real and imaginary, and secured
various benefits to those who resorted to them. One
or more such wise people were to be found in every
district, and any accusation of <i>witchcraft</i>, of dabbling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
in forbidden arts, or of being in league with the
devil, would be indignantly resented by them. On
the contrary, as in the case of a shepherd in upper
Argyllshire, who was much resorted to for the magic
cure of cattle, they claimed that their powers were
given for a good purpose, and to counteract the Powers
of Evil.</p>

<p>The machinery by which they secured these blessings
to humanity, consisted of rhymes or incantations,
rites and ceremonies, plants and stones of virtue,
observance of propitious seasons, etc. The use of
these could only lead indirectly to harm by fostering a
spirit of credulity, and preventing inquiry into natural
causes. Of themselves, the charms were like the
Sunday plant, according to a common Gaelic saying,
“without benefit or harm.” Any other rhyme or
ceremony, plant or stone, would do equally well, if
its use commanded the same amount of belief. The
words or rhymes were praiseworthy commendations
addressed to various saints, and the rites were harmless
and merely trifling. This kind of superstition still
prevails among the lower ranks of society to an almost
incredible extent in the south as well as in the
Highlands, and ‘wise people’ are resorted to for the
cure of obscure ailments by many of whom such folly
might be little suspected. Not above five years ago<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
the daughter of a dairy farmer in Cowal came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Ardnamurchan, a distance of above 100 miles, to
obtain from a man of reputed skill a charm to turn
aside the misfortunes and maladies by which her father’s
dairy was afflicted. She went home happy in the
possession of a bottle of water, over which some
magic words had been muttered. Occasional newspaper
paragraphs show the practice is not extinct
in England or the south of Scotland.</p>

<p>In the case of sick beasts, when, <i>e.g.</i>, a horse lies
down and refuses to rise, or a cow ceases to give
milk, or gives only milk mingled with blood, the usual
mode of procedure to effect a magic cure is to go
to a person of skill (<i>i.e.</i> a white witch), get a bottle of
water prepared by whispering certain words over it,
and sprinkle this on the sick beast, or perhaps put
a few drops in its ear. Immediately the beast rises
without anything being the matter with it. Other
rhymes and ceremonies are ready for other occasions,
and it would be possible to fill a book with a collection
of incantations in use for various diseases or in
different localities.</p>

<p>The general name for trifling superstitious observances
of the kind is <i>Gisreag, Eapag, Upag</i>. The
different kinds are known as <i>Eòlas</i> (Knowledge) for
the cure of disease; <i>Oradh</i> (Gilding) for securing gifts
and graces; <i>Sïan</i> or <i>Seun</i> for protection from danger,
and <i>Soisgeul</i> (<i>Gospel</i>) for weak minds. The rhymes
contain internal evidence of having come from Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Catholic times. The invocation of the Trinity and the
Saints, particularly St. Bride and St. Columba, St.
Michael and St. Peter, is common to them all, and
whatever be their merit as expressions of piety, they
certainly convey no idea of traffic with the Powers
of Evil. The utmost that truth can urge against
those who use them is, that they are ignorant, facile,
and credulous. The opprobrious name of <i>buidseachas</i>
is in every case sincerely and piously repudiated by
themselves, and in reality is unjust.</p>

<p>These charms are not readily accessible. The following
have been collected from many different persons,
and are of interest, some as illustrative of the
antiquities of the Scottish Highlands, and some for
their poetical merits. Much of the chosen poetry
consists in felicity of expression, and this is a merit
next to impossible to infuse into a translation. No
attempt is here made to do more than give the exact
meaning of the original.</p>

<h3>EOLAS.</h3>

<p>The <i>Eòlas</i> (Knowledge), called also <i>Teagasg</i> (Teaching),
was a charm for the cure of sickness in man or
beast. It consisted of a rhyme, muttered over the
sick person, and over water to be drunk by, or
sprinkled over, the sick animal. To render it more
impressive, its use was accompanied by trifling little
ceremonies, such as making the sign of the cross,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
yawning, making up mysterious parti-coloured strings,
getting particular kinds of water on particular days,
dipping stones of virtue in water, and similar mummeries.
Its object was a good one, and this much
can be said in its favour, that if it did not cure, it did
not kill.</p>

<p>The ills, for which the <i>Eòlas</i> was used, are generally
transitory in their nature, as toothache, bruises, sprains,
etc., and improvement or cure, following soon after its
performance, kept alive a belief in the efficacy of the
incantation. The rhymes are usually found in the
possession of old women of the humblest class, to
whom a meal or small present from a more affluent
neighbour, for a bottle of water and a harmless rhyme,
is a welcome gift. These old women, it may be said
in every case, believe in the efficacy of the charm as
much as those who resort to them; but, while the
whole company and its proceedings afford good grounds
for ridicule, indignation or reprobation fairly attach
themselves only to those who go to seek such foolish
cures for sickness. The excuse of the poor white witch
is to be found in the pressure of want, and the relief,
which the Gaelic saying truthfully but coarsely embodies,
“It is good fun that fills the belly” (<i>’s math an
spōrs a līonas brū</i>).</p>

<p>Not a word of any kind was to be spoken by the
person going for an <i>Eòlas</i>, till he came home again, to
any one but the ‘wise’ person. This was because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Elisha, when he sent his servant before him to the
Shunammite woman (2 Kings iv. 29), commanded him
not to speak on the way. “If thou meet any man,
salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him
not again.”</p>

<p>On the way, the messenger must take up his quarters
for the night before the sun goes down; and no
spinning or reading is allowed. There is more probability
of the charm becoming efficacious if he enter
no house and take no meat.</p>

<h3>CURE FOR THE EVIL EYE.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Eòlas a chronachaidh.</i>)</p>

<p>An evil eye, according to the Highland belief, is
one animated by a discontented and unhappy mind,
full of envy (<i>farmad</i>), covetousness (<i>sanntachadh</i>), and
such like mean feelings, and looking repiningly on the
good of others, and it may be too earnestly and
anxiously on what belongs to oneself. It injures the
object on which it falls, and animals or persons struck
by it are seized with mysterious ailments, dwindle, and
perhaps die.</p>

<p>The believers in the gift assert that the evil eye may
exist in man or woman, in friend or foe, and that it
is prudent not to give causes for the feelings which
give rise to it. Thus, for instance, it is advisable not
to allow a cow to go without a full udder. An evil
eye may rest upon it, and the animal be lost. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
practice is commendable, though the reason assigned
may not be the correct one. From a similar fear, a
pedlar has been known to go about with his goods
only at night. A mother can hurt her own child, and
some have been said to hurt their own cattle. The
traditions of various localities, in the islands and on
the mainland, tell of a man who was not allowed to
see his own cattle, from his possession of the unhappy
gift. If he did see them, one of the best cows was
found dead next day.</p>

<p>When a healthy and thriving child is seized with
unaccountable illness, and becomes uneasy and sickly,
it is suspected of being struck with the evil eye, and a
‘wise’ woman of the neighbourhood is sent for. She
fills a bowl with clean water, into which she puts a
silver sixpence. The bowl is then quickly, and dexterously
turned upside down. If the sixpence stick to
its bottom, the child is the victim of an evil eye (<i>air a
chronachadh</i>), and the usual remedy is adopted.</p>

<p>An elder of the church, who was witness to the
ceremony some fifty years ago, thus describes it (and
he is a person very likely to have been observant even
in his boyhood). “When a little boy, I wandered into
a neighbour’s house, very likely with a piece of seaweed
in my hand, and chewing away at it, as the
manner of boys is. There was a child in the house
very ill, but I did not think or know of this when I
entered. I suppose the little thing had not sucked its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
mother’s breast, or taken any nourishment, for some
days previously. An old woman, who came to inquire
for it, on learning its condition, took a bowl half-full of
water from a large tub (<i>farmail</i>) that was in the house,
and putting it on her knees began to mutter over it. I
was too young at the time to be heeded, and was not
put out of the house. After muttering for a while, the
old woman began to yawn, and such yawning I have
never seen in all my days. She yawned, and yawned,
and yawned again, till I thought she was going to
die. The cat’s paws were dipped in the bowl on her
knee, and a red thread, brought by a girl belonging to
the house, on being also dipped in the water, was put
round the child’s neck.”</p>

<p>The water used must be that in which the “hunter’s
feet” have been dipped (<i>uisge casan an t-sealgair</i>), and
the cat is the hunter most readily available. The
muttered words are the charm, which gives the whole
ceremony its efficacy, and the yawning commences
when the child’s illness is being transferred to the person
who performs the ceremony.</p>

<p>The Evil Eye is deadly to all animals to which the
person having it takes a fancy. In the present day it
is said of a man in Tiree, who is accused by common
report of having the gift, that when he comes to buy a
beast it is better to give it to him at his own price than
keep it. If he does not get it, the beast is taken ill
and perhaps dies soon after. This is said, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
maligned man never gets better bargains than his
neighbours.</p>

<p>When a stranger having an evil eye meets a rider
or person leading a horse, and praises the animal’s
points, the effects of his looks are soon evident. Before
he is out of sight the horse is suddenly taken ill and
falls down. The rider should immediately return after
the evil-eyed stranger, and boldly accuse him of having
done the mischief. The more “bitterly and abusively”
(<i>gu searbh salach</i>) he does so the better. On coming
back he will find the horse all right. If on his guard
at the first meeting, when the stranger praises the
horse, he will praise it a great deal more. When the
stranger says, “That is a good animal,” the prudent
owner will say, “It is better than that,” and however
high the stranger’s praises are, the owner’s should be
higher. This will lessen, perhaps prevent, the power of
the evil eye to do mischief.</p>

<p>In the prose part of a Gaelic poem published
in M’Kenzie’s <i>Beauties</i>, Gilbride Macintyre, from Ruaig,
in Tiree, is said to have killed eighty hens with
one glance of his evil eye, and to have wrecked a big
ship of five cross-trees, notwithstanding her cables and
anchors. A man in Rocky Mound (<i>Cnoc Creagach</i>), in
Coll, killed a mare and foal with it. It is said the wife
of a former tenant of Heynish, in Tiree (and the story
is localised in several other places), would not allow her
husband to look at his own fold of cattle. As sure as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
he did so, one of his best cows was found dead next
day. The fear of this calamity made her put a very
pretty cow, to which she herself took a great fancy, in
an out-of-the-way place, near which her husband had
never been observed to go. On returning one day from
a stroll in the hill, he asked who put the cow where
he had seen it. The wife’s worst fears were realised.
The cow was dead in a few days.</p>

<p>The credulous (of whom there is a large number
everywhere) were assured that, when any beast belonging
to them was praised, all evil consequences were
averted by their saying:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“God bless your eye,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">A drop of wine about your heart,</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is a Gaelic saying that “Envy splits the rocks”
(<i>sgoiltidh farmad na creagan</i>), and in proof of this the
following story is told. An industrious, careful man
sold more cheese than his neighbours, and was much
envied when seen, as he frequently was, on his way to
market with a cheese in a bag on his back. One day,
instead of a cheese, he put a small mill-stone in the
bag. His neighbours, filled with envy, saw him jogging
along as usual to market, and stood in their doors looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
after him and making remarks. On reaching the
market and opening the bag he found the mill-stone
broken in two, a certain proof of the power of envy and
of the truth embodied in the proverb.</p>

<p>The charm for curing the Evil Eye, like many other
similar mummeries, must be made on Thursday or
Sunday. The rhyme used varies with different localities.
The following, with slight variations on the part of
different individuals, is the one used in Tiree. The
words within brackets are omitted when the charm is
for a sick beast:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">For my own eye,</div>
<div class="verse">For the grey man’s eye,</div>
<div class="verse">For the eye of the nine slim fairy women,</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The five last lines probably mean, that the fairies or
elves, whom God has rendered invisible, are speaking
among themselves over the sick person, and the succour
of the twelve apostles and of Christ is more powerful
than the injustice of man. Others for these lines
substitute the following:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A woman in Islay worked wonderful cures with the
following. It is a wretched specimen of superstition,
but is given to show how ancient creeds accommodate
themselves to modern modes of thought. The ancient
charm, instead of being entirely abandoned, became a
sort of prayer:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This was to be said thrice.</p>

<h3>CHARM FOR SPRAINS.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Eòlas an t-sìochaidh.</i>)</p>

<p>This charm also to be efficacious must be thrice

have been almost entirely in the omission of lines in
some that are found in others:</p>

<p class="noindent">Part of the charm consisted of a handful of earth
from a grey mound (<i>làn an dùirn an ùir a cnoc glas</i>)
applied to the foot. The sufferer must go three times
<i>deiseal</i> (southwardly) round the mound on Sunday. In
the extreme west of Tiree there is a hillock called
<i>Cnocan an t-sìachaidh</i> (the hillock of the sprain), but
the practice of using it for cures of this kind has
become obsolete.</p>

<h3>CHARM FOR TOOTHACHE.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Eòlas an Déide.</i>)</p>

<p>It is not difficult to persuade a man distracted with
toothache to try any remedy in reason that offers any
hope of relief. It would be curious if a charm were
not forthcoming. The writer has recovered only a
portion of the Gaelic version. The following English
charm was obtained ten years ago in Tiree, and probably
came originally from the Isle of Man. It was
to be sewn up in the clothes and worn about the
person, and was given to those who applied for it for
a small consideration. This was to be on Sunday, and
payment was not to be asked for. If that had to be
done, the charm was useless. The copy is word for
word:</p>

<p>“In the name of lord petter sat on a marble stone
aweeping Christ came by and said what else you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
petter petter said o lord my god my dok toockage
christ said o lord petter be whole and not thou only
but all that carry these lines in my name shall never
have the toock Christ cure the toockaig.”</p>

<h3>MADE FOR MERRION MACFADYN.</h3>

<p>In a small tract called Peacock’s <i>Guide to the
Isle of Man</i> (p. 66), the following version is given as
in use in that island:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Peter was ordained a saint</div>
<div class="verse">Standing on a marble stone,</div>
<div class="verse">Jesus came to him alone,</div>
<div class="verse">And said to him, ‘Peter!</div>
<div class="verse">What is it that makes thee shake?’</div>
<div class="verse">Peter replied, ‘My Lord and Master,</div>
<div class="verse">It is the toothache’;</div>
<div class="verse">Jesus said to him,</div>
<div class="verse">‘Rise up and be healed!</div>
<div class="verse">Keep these words for my sake,</div>
<div class="verse">And thou shalt nevermore be troubled with toothache’.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Gaelic is to the same effect:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The charm Colum-Kil applied</div>
<div class="verse">To Mal-ii’s right knee,</div>

<div class="verse">Toothache and disease of the head.</div>
<div class="verse">...</div>
<div class="verse">Then said Peter to James,</div>
<div class="verse">‘I can get no peace or rest with the toothache.’</div>
<div class="verse">...</div>
<div class="verse">Christ said, ‘Answer the question,</div>
<div class="verse">And the toothache and the verse</div>
<div class="verse">Will never be in the same head together’.”</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHARMS FOR CATTLE.</h3>

<p>These were even more numerous than those for the
distempers of men. Cattle are nowadays better housed,
fed, and attended to, and hence are not so liable to ill-understood
ailments that gave persons of ‘skill’
employment.</p>

<p>In the case of any beast being seized with distemper,
this short charm might prove of use:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Whoever has done you this deed of malice,</div>
<div class="verse">A brown man or white woman,</div>
<div class="verse">I send these Three to check them,</div>
<div class="verse">The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A more obstinate case demanded the charm for the
Evil Eye, water in which stones of virtue were dipped
etc.</p>

<p>When a newly purchased animal is brought home, its
return to its former home is prevented, and its allurement
to its new haunts is secured by blowing into its
ear, and saying:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“A blowing into your right ear,</div>
<div class="verse">For your benefit and not your hurt,</div>
<div class="verse">Love of the land under your foot,</div>
<div class="verse">And dislike to the land you left,</div>

<p>When a cow loses its milk, as is sometimes the case,
whatever be the cause (perhaps the eating of a noxious
weed), it is necessary to procure the pearlwort and two
other plants known to people of skill, to bring back the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
milk. The following words are to be said when pulling
the plants:</p>

<h3>CHARM AGAINST DANGER (<i>Sian</i>).</h3>

<p>The <i>seun</i> or <i>sian</i>, Scot. <i>sain</i>, was used for the protection
of both man and beast from particular dangers,
such as being taken away by an enemy, being drowned,
or struck by sword, or arrow, or bullet in battle. It
consisted of rhymes, or parti-coloured strings, or plants,
and in many cases its nature remained a mystery. It
was said over cows and sheep when leaving them for
the night; it was put round the necks of infants; given
by the fairy mistress (<i>leannan sìth</i>) to her earthly lover;
sewn by the foster-mother (<i>muime</i>) in the clothes of a
beloved foster-son (<i>dalta</i>) about to leave her, etc. After
it was once given or said, the two, the giver and the
recipient, must not see each other again. If they did
the charm lost its power. Usually there was some
unforeseen danger of the class which the charm was
intended to provide against that proved fatal. Thus,
it is said, a young woman gave a <i>sian</i> to her soldier
lover, who was leaving for foreign wars, telling him the
only thing he had to guard against was his own arms.
He went scatheless through a protracted war, but after
his return scratched his forehead with a pin which he
carried in his clothes, and died from the effects.</p>

<p>A smith in Torosa, Mull, was said to have got a
charm of this kind from his father. He afterwards
enlisted, and was in thirty battles. On coming home
without a wound, he said he had often wished he was
dead, rather than be bruised as he was by bullets. They
struck him, but could not pierce him because of the
charm.</p>

<p>Red Hector of the Battles (<i>Eachunn Ruadh nan
Cath</i>), a celebrated chief of the M’Leans of Dowart, had
a <i>sian</i>, which made him invulnerable in the many conflicts,
from which he derived his designation. It failed
him at the battle of Inverkeithing, in 1652, when he
fell with 1500 of his clan. Surrounded by overwhelming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
numbers, and sorely wounded, he maintained a
hopeless struggle, his gallant clansmen defending him
to the last, “each stepping where his comrade stood the
instant that he fell,” and calling out, in an expression
which has been since proverbial in his native island,
“Another for Hector!” (<i>Fear eile air son Eachuinn</i>).</p>

<p>The charm, which his fairy mistress gave to Thinman
(<i>Caoilte</i>), the fastest hero of the Fians, has been already
referred to.</p>

<p>When washing new-born babes wise women made
use of these words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">“Hale fair washing to thee,</div>

<h3>CHARM FOR CLOTH.</h3>

<p>After being fulled, new cloth was folded and placed
on a table. The women, who had been engaged in the
fulling, then gathered round it and sang the following
charm seven times. During the singing they kept time
to the music by raising their hands simultaneously and
beating the cloth with the tips of their fingers. After
each repetition of the charm the cloth was turned over
end:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent3">“Well do I say my verse,</div>
<div class="verse indent3">As I descend the glen,</div>

<div class="verse indent4">And may he never be torn,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>

<div class="verse">And in the slender body of the speckled salmon.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Then, striking the cloth faster, the singers say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Let this be second cloth, and not enemy’s spoil,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor property of clerk or priest.</div>
<div class="verse">But his own property, and may he enjoy and wear it.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is said there is a bone in the herring’s head
that resembles a deer’s foot. Some say the word
should not be “deer’s shank” (<i>Lurg an fhéidh</i>), but
“deer’s antlers” (<i>Cuibhn’an fhéidh</i>). The part of the
song within brackets seems to belong to the music
more than to the meaning. The final wish is that
the cloth when turned, or made into a second suit,
may prove as good as new, and not, like cloth found
on dead bodies, a perquisite of the priest’s. In olden
times the seventh yard (<i>slat</i>) of chequered cloth (<i>Clò
Breac</i>) was given to the factor and priest, as well as
the seventh lamb from the fold.</p>

<h3>CHARM TO KEEP AWAY HARM IN A LAWSUIT.</h3>

<p>When a person is pulled up at law for abusive
language, let him when entering the court-house spit in
his fist, grasp his staff firmly, and say the following
words. There is then no danger of being found guilty.
The charm was originally got from Big Allan of Woodend
(<i>Ailein Mòr cheannacoille</i>), in Kingairloch, who had
been a soldier at the time of the Irish Rebellion, and
had himself learned it in his youth. The names of the
saints show the charm to be very ancient.</p>

<p>The name “Manaman MacLeth” is probably a corruption
of “Manannan MacLeirr,” the Manx magician,
who is said to have covered that island with a mist,
which was dispelled by St. Patrick. <i>Ni-Mhanainnein</i>
(<i>i.e.</i> the daughter of Manannain) is mentioned in a
Gaelic tale as having remarkably beautiful music in
her house, and “the Dairy-maid, the daughter of Manannan”
(<i>Bhanachag ni Mhannainein</i>) is mentioned in
another tale as a midwife, whose residence was somewhere
near the moon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>In addition to magic cures by means of rhymes,
many were effected, and much security was obtained,
by means of beads, stones, and plants. A collection of
these formed a considerable part of the armoury of
witches, black and white.</p>

<h3>SERPENT STONE.</h3>

<p>Of all the means of which superstition laid hold for
the cure of disease in man or beast, the foremost place
is to be assigned to the Serpent Stone (<i>Clach Nathrach</i>),
also called the Serpent Bead or Glass (<i>Glaine Nathair</i>).
It is an undoubted relique of Druidism, and as such
worthy of particular attention.</p>

<p>Pliny (29 c. 3) tells us that the Emperor Claudius
put to death a knight of the Vocontian Gauls for carrying
a serpent-egg (<i>ovum anguinum</i>) about him while
engaged in a lawsuit. He also gives a description of
the manner in which the egg or bead is manufactured
by the serpents. In summer innumerable serpents
enwrap one another, and generate the egg from the
slaver of their jaws and bodies. They then, according
to the Druids, cast it up into the air by their hissings,
when it must be caught in a garment lest it touch the
ground. The person who is bold enough to intercept
it must fly away on a horse, for the serpents follow till
a river intercepts them. The test of a true egg is, that
it swims against the stream, even if bound in gold (<i>si
contra aquas fluitet, vel auro vinctum</i>). The Druids<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
further say it must be got at a particular season of the
moon. The one Pliny saw was about the size of a
round apple. It procures victory in lawsuits, and
entrance to kings.</p>

<p>The tales told in modern times of the Serpent Stone,
its manufacture and wonderful properties, are of a
similar class, and leave no doubt that in these beads and
the use made of them we have the remains of an imposture,
if not instituted, at least practised by the
Druids.</p>

<p>The ordinary <i>Glaine Nathair</i> (Serpent Glass) is of
smaller size than is indicated by Pliny. The one which
the writer saw was about the size of a gun bullet, and
about 1¼ in. long. There was a hole through from end
to end, and depressions on its sides, as if it had once
been soft, and had been taken up gently between the
finger and thumb. It is of transparent glass, but glass
unlike that of the present day. There are extremely
brilliant and curious streaks of colour in it. It is now
merely a family heir-loom, but in olden times was in
great demand for dipping in water to be given to
bewitched persons or beasts. The sloughed skin
(<i>cochull</i>) of the serpent itself was used for the same
purpose. Water in which it was dipped was given to
sick beasts. The tale as to the manner in which it
was originally got is the same as is told of other beads
of the same kind. The serpents are assembled in a
coiling mass, with their heads in the air hissing horribly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
slavering, and out of their slaver making the serpent
stone. The spittle, in course of becoming solid, was
known as <i>meall èochd</i>. That the story was not implicitly
believed is shown by the addition that, when
the bead is finished, one of the serpents puts its tail
through it. Thus the hole by which it is perforated is
made.</p>

<p>In the case of the Bead which the writer saw, the
person who came upon the serpents at their work is
said to have waited till the reptiles slept. He then
worked the bead out of their circle with a straw or
twig of heather. As he took it up between his finger
and thumb, and made off with it, he observed that the
pressure of his fingers marked it, it being still soft, and
this made him put a straw through it to carry it home.
This story fairly accounts for the shape of the bead
and the marks upon it. The marks look as if they
were so made when the stone was soft. Another
account says that the finder came on a rock above
where the serpents were at work, and, rolling his plaid
into a ball, threw it down the rock near them.
Instantly the serpents made a dash at the plaid, and
while they were reducing it to shreds he made off
with the Adder Stone. By means of a sharp-pointed
stick, prepared for the purpose, and thrust through
the soft bead, he raised it to the top of the rock,
and, taking it between his finger and thumb, ran
home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Similar legends of the Adder Stone were current in
the Lowlands. Scott says the name is applied “to
celts and other perforated stones.” In the Highlands
the name is not applied to stones. In Wales and
Ireland the Bead is known as “Druid’s Glass.” A
more than historical interest attaches to it, from the
means it gives of tracing, beyond the possibility of
mistake, the use of amulets and superstitious charms
to the times and teaching of the much-lauded Druids,
and raises, if it does not throw light upon, questions as
to the early intercourse of nations.</p>

<p>The manufacture of serpent beads is involved in
obscurity. There is nothing known to create a probability
that they are of Celtic workmanship. The
Phœnicians from a very early date knew the art of
glass-making, and their commerce extended far and
wide, and as far as the shores of the British Isles, then
the remotest part of the known world. It is, therefore,
possible these beads came from Phœnician sources.
They are, it is said, found on the coasts of the Baltic
and Mediterranean, in England and France, as well as
in Ireland and Scotland, and it is possible enough their
diffusion was owing to traders from Phœnicia and her
colonies in Gaul and at Massilia. Similarly, idols are
exported, at the present day from England to India.
Fully as much, however, can be urged in behalf of a
supposition that the beads are of Egyptian origin, and
were obtained by the Celtic priests from the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Egyptian enchanters. The Egyptians from the earliest
times used glass extensively, and could cut, grind, and
engrave it, inlay it with gold, imitate precious stones in
it, and colour it with great brilliancy. A bead found
at Thebes is ascribed to <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> 1500, and relics of a
similar class are not unfrequently found in the Egyptian
catacombs. If they could be said to be of exactly the
same manufacture with the Celtic beads, the question is
nearly set at rest. Meyer gives it as his view that the
first westward stream of Celtic immigration passed
through Egypt, along the north coast of Africa, and
entered Europe by the Straits of Gibraltar. Ancient
Irish history, if there be any truth in its fables, points
to a similar conclusion. The subject is one of which
nothing certain is known, and its decision is of value in
showing whether the Celtic priests got their aids to
superstition from their Egyptian brethren.</p>

<h3>SNAIL BEADS (<i>Cnaipein Seilcheig</i>).</h3>

<p>Snails also are said to form themselves into a mass
and manufacture a stone of great virtue as a charm
(<i>Clach shianaidh</i>). It protects its lucky possessor
against all danger. Its name is “a snail bead”
(<i>Cnaipein seilcheig</i>), or “a snail stone” (<i>Clach na seilcheig</i>).
Four or five snails are engaged in the manufacture
of each stone. Water in which it is dipped is
good for sore eyes and for mouths broken out with
tetter.</p>

<h3>FROG STONE.</h3>

<p>The King Frog has in its head a stone of immense
value. “The Frog Stone” (<i>Clach nan gilleadha cràigein</i>)
is said by Pennant to be merely a kind of fossil tooth,
known as bufonite. It has been made the best known
of this class of physical charms, from Shakespeare’s
comparison of adversity to the toad, which, though “ugly
and venomous,” yet “wears a precious jewel in its head.”</p>

<p>The swamp at Achagaval in Morvern was tenanted
by a King Frog or Toad, the reputation of which was
widespread. It was called <i>Seid</i>, a word of which the
usual meaning is “a truss of hay or straw.” One,
who stayed in the neighbourhood of the fen, said, he
heard, not once but scores of times, the cry of the
animal from as great a distance as the top of a
neighbouring hill, <i>Beinn nam Bearrach</i>, and he could
compare it to nothing so much as the yelping of “a
soft mastiff whelp” (<i>bog chuilein tòdhlair</i>). The part
of the fen which the King Frog most frequented was
called <i>Lòn na Seid</i>, and in winter, when it was frozen
over, a tame otter was let down through a hole in the
ice in the hope of driving the frog to the opening.
Otters must come occasionally to the surface to breathe,
and the one in question having come for that purpose,
its owner, in his eagerness to secure the jewel, mistook
it for the King Frog, and gave it a rap on the
head that killed it on the spot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<h3>STONES.</h3>

<p>In addition to jewels found in animals, superstition
made use of stones of various forms, spherical and
pointed, plain and ornamented, of unknown origin, but
bearing evidence of having been reduced to form by
human art. These were carefully preserved in families
as heirlooms, and are found in tumuli, graves, and
road-cuttings, dredged from rivers, and turned up by
the plough. They are undoubted relics of a remote
past, and have been referred by antiquaries to a
prehistoric age and savages who lived before iron was
invented. The ingenuity of those who advocate this
view of their origin is sufficiently tested in finding a
practical use for the stones as weapons of war or the
chase, as employed in games of chance, or as articles of
domestic use, corn-crushers, hatchets, or personal ornaments.
No doubt many of them were originally
intended for such purposes; but the uselessness of
others and the absence of fitness for any known or
conceivable purpose of utility, indicate a different
origin. It is not easy, for instance, to assign any
ordinary use to such a stone-ball as that pictured in
Wilson’s <i>Prehistoric Annals of Scotland</i>, i., 195, and to
many others of still more curious appearance and
with more elaborate ornaments. The incised ornaments
forbid the idea of their being of ordinary
service, and the prevalence of witchcraft, with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
armoury of curiously-shaped stones and mysterious
natural productions, among all savage tribes, makes
it highly probable they were the implements of the
prehistoric conjurer’s craft, and were from the first
associated with strange virtues. As a lethal weapon
the first stone picked up from the ground was as
serviceable. They have been associated with the
popular superstitions of very modern times. It is not
unlikely that from the beginning they were so associated.</p>

<h3>FAIRY ARROW.</h3>

<p>The most common of these primitive relics was the
Fairy Arrow or Elf-bolt (<i>saighead shith</i>, pron. <i>saït hee</i>),
which was believed to be thrown by the Fairies at
cattle and men. It was said in the Highlands the
elves could not throw it themselves, but compelled
some mortal, who was at that time being carried in
their company, to do so. When friendly, he missed
his aim, and so disappointed his instigators. A person
struck instantaneously lost the power of his limbs, and
was taken to the Fairy dwelling. Only his semblance
remained. He appeared to die, or an old Elf was
substituted for him, to animate the powerless frame and
receive the kindness bestowed by mortals on what they
thought was their afflicted friend. Similarly elf-struck
cattle devoured all the food and gave all the trouble
of healthy cattle, but yielded no return; they neither
gave milk nor grew fat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>The Elf-bolt is a flint flake reduced with patient
ingenuity to the form of an arrow-head, and is in
length from one to six inches. Archæologists say
these flints formed the arrow and the lance heads of a
primitive stone race, but their unsuitableness for being
firmly secured to a proper shaft alone makes this
supposition not always likely. An arrow with a flint
for a head must have been too weighty at one end,
and the Allophylian (if there was such a person) must
have been very destitute of ingenuity if he could not
make a more serviceable arrow-head from bone splinters
or hardened wood. When men believed in Fairies
these flint heads made their appearance as readily as
images do under a system of idolatry.</p>

<p>Whoever had one of these arrows in his possession
was safe from Fairy attacks, and water in which it was
dipped restored to health man or beast struck with
sudden illness.</p>

<p>Similar virtues were ascribed to the Fairy Spade
(<i>Caibe sìth</i>), a smooth, slippery, black stone (<i>mìn
sleamhuinn du</i>), supposed to resemble a spade. It was
also put in water to be given to sick people and cattle.</p>

<h3>CRUBAN STONE.</h3>

<p>The Cruban Stone (<i>Clach a Chrùbain</i>) cured diseases
in the joints. It is said by Pennant to have been that
species of fossil-shell called gryphite. Its name is
from <i>crùban</i>, a sitting, or squatting, or crouching attitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
in man or beast, the result of a disease in the feet
that makes them unable to stand. A stone of this
kind in Breadalbane was lent only under a pledge of
two cows (<i>an geall càraid cruidh</i>). If the stone was
not returned the cows were to be forfeited.</p>

<h3>VARIOUS.</h3>

<p>A round stone, exactly resembling the one above
referred to, as pictured by Wilson, with six regularly
arranged circles carved upon it, was long in the possession
of a family in Knapdale, and is now in Tiree. It
was used for the relief of colic pains and other internal
gripings, and was believed to cast a skin (<i>tilg rusg</i>) when
put in the water to be used. It was called <i>Clach a
Ghreimich</i>, the Gripe Stone. There was a companion
stone of the same size for the cure of the Evil-Eye.
Mary Macintyre, the noted Fort-William witch, a native
of Barra, had a stone called <i>Clach na Léig</i>, the pebble of
healing virtues, with a hole in it, through which she
thrust her tongue previous to making divinations. It
was of a blue colour, and by means of it Mary could
give young women accounts of their sweethearts, secure
for seamen and others who came to Fort-William with
flesh and other commodities a sale for their goods, etc.</p>

<p>There is a stone in Caolas, Tiree, called <i>Clach na
stoirm</i>, the Storm Stone, almost entirely buried in the
ground. If taken out of the ground, cleaned, and set
upright, it will cause a storm to arise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>The Ardvoirlich Stone (in Perthshire) was used for
the cure of murrain in cattle. A person going for it
must not speak, or sit, or enter a house, or be found
outside a house after sunset. He must take up his
quarters for the night before the sun sets.</p>

<h3><i>Soisgeul</i>, GOSPEL.</h3>

<p>A “Gospel” consisted of a verse of Scripture, or a
hymn, or some good words, usually got from the priest,
and sewn in the clothes to keep the wearer from weakness
of mind, and as a protection from spite (<i>air son
inntinn lag ’s droch rùn</i>). When going for it, a person
must not speak to anyone on the way, and must take
up his lodgings for the night before the sun goes
down.</p>

<h3>MISCELLANEOUS CURES.</h3>

<p>Besides all these magic cures, there were others
practised by boys and resorted to by the superstitious,
without much thought as to there being magic in them
or not. The cure in many cases was supposed to be
effected or the desired gift conferred by natural means.</p>

<h3>WARTS (<i>Foineachun</i>).</h3>

<p>These were cured by putting in a bag as many knots
or joints of straw or grass (<i>glùinean shop</i>) as there were
warts to be banished, and leaving them on the public
road. The first person who lifted the bag was to have
the warts in future. Another equally efficacious plan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
was to take a grain of barley (<i>spilgein eòrna</i>) for every
wart and bury it in some retired spot, where it was
never to be disturbed. Should both these simple cures
fail, pig’s blood was applied to the warts and rubbed
off with a clout. This cloth was made up into a parcel
and left on the road. The warts were removed to the
hands of the first person who opened it.</p>

<h3>STYE (<i>Neònagan</i>).</h3>

<p>A stye on the eye (pron. <i>sleònachan</i>) was cured by
putting one end of a stick in the fire, pointing the burning
end towards the sore eye, and whirling it round
rapidly in a circle, saying, “A stye one, a stye two, a
stye three,” etc., down to “a stye nine,” and then
adding, “take yourself off, stye.” The charm was also
performed by repeating, while the stick was being whirled,
“Go back, go back, go back, stye” (<i>air ais, air ais</i>, etc.).
Others placed great faith in rubbing the eye with gold.</p>

<h3>TETTER (<i>Teine-dé</i>, HERPES LABIALIS).</h3>

<p>Boys troubled with eruptions on the mouth were
infuriated by a rhyme:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“A tetter on your mouth,</div>
<div class="verse">Your step-mother laid an egg,</div>
<div class="verse">And you hatched the brood.”<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>The first part of the name is <i>teine</i>, a fire, and a
curious question arises as to what <i>dé</i> is. It occurs also
in <i>dearbadan dé</i>, a butterfly. It looks like the genitive
of <i>dia</i>, god.</p>

<h3>HICCUP (<i>an aileag</i>)</h3>

<p class="noindent">was cured by accusing the person who had it of theft.
This stands somewhat to reason in the case of children.
If they be ingenuous, such an accusation skilfully made
rouses their nature to such an extent that the hiccup
disappears.</p>

<h3>HOOPING-COUGH (<i>an trigh</i>, <i>an trîugh</i>).</h3>

<p>It was a saying: “Whoever drinks mare’s milk with
an aspen spoon will have hooping-cough but slightly”
(<i>Fear sam bi dh’ òlas bainne capuill le spàin chrithionn,
cha ghabh e’n trigh ach aotrom</i>).</p>

<h3>STIFF NECK,</h3>

<p class="noindent">such as may be got from sleeping with too high a
pillow or the head awry, was cured by squeezing the
neck between the legs of the tongs.</p>

<h3>TOOTHACHE (<i>Déide</i>).</h3>

<p>This excruciating disease was supposed to be capable
of cure by putting a dead man’s finger or a coffin nail
in the mouth, and people have been known in their
agony to try both expedients. The person resorting
to this cure must go for the nail or dead man’s finger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
to the graveyard (<i>roluig</i>), though very likely this part
of the experiment was rarely tried. As in the case
of those who go to have a tooth pulled, the pain
disappeared on the way.</p>

<h3>FALLING SICKNESS (<i>an tuiteamas</i>).</h3>

<p>When a new-born child is being washed, a straw
rope (<i>sioman</i>) twined round it, and then cut in pieces,
is a safeguard during life against epilepsy, falling
sickness (<i>tinneas tuiteamas</i>), or as it was euphemistically
called, “the out sickness” (<i>an tinneas a-muigh</i>). In
Sutherlandshire, a second attack was supposed to be
prevented by burying a cock alive when the first
occurred.</p>

<h3>MADNESS.</h3>

<p>In the Highlands, as elsewhere, rough usage (often
amounting to brutality) was believed to be the most
suitable treatment for those suffering under this the
greatest of human misfortunes, mental aberration.</p>

<p>On a Thursday (it should be no other day), a
person was to take the lunatic behind him on a
<i>grey</i> horse, and gallop at the horse’s utmost speed
three times round a boundary mark (<i>comharra criche</i>),
and then to an immovable stone. On making the
madman speak to this stone the cure was complete.</p>

<p>A plan (of which there are traditions in the Hebrides)
was to put a rope round the madman’s waist and
drag him after a boat till he was nearly dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>In Strathfillan (<i>Srath Fhaolain</i>), of which the
common name is “the straths” (<i>sraithibh</i>), in Perthshire,
is a pool in the river, which winds through
the strath, and the ruins of a chapel at Clachan, about
half a mile distant, which at one time enjoyed a wide
reputation for the cure of this affliction. One who
was alive a few years ago and used to assist at the
ceremonies to be observed in the chapel, remembered
as many as twelve madmen being left tied there
at a time. Tradition says St. Fillan had in his
possession a stone of marvellous virtue. Some people
were taking it from him by violence when he threw
it in a deep pool in the river, and from this the
pool derived its miraculous virtue. Mad people were
made to go three times <i>deiseal</i> (<i>i.e.</i> keeping the pool
on their right hand) round the linn, and then were
plunged headlong in. On being taken out, three
stones were lifted from the pool and placed in a cairn,
which may still be seen. A stone bowl was filled
with water to be consecrated and poured on the
patient’s head. The madman was taken to the
chapel and placed on his back on the ground, stretched
between two sticks, and laced round with ropes in
a very simple manner. If he succeeded in extricating
himself before morning good hopes were entertained
of his recovery. The ropes were so arranged that
he could do so easily. He had only to push them
from him towards his feet, but if he was outrageous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
he was hopelessly entangled. The pool lost its virtue
in consequence of a mad bull having been thrown into
it. It is now known as “the bull’s pool” (<i>linne
’n tairbh</i>).</p>

<h3><i>Màm</i>, AXILLARY SWELLING.</h3>

<p>A swelling of the axillary glands (<i>fàireagun na
h-achlais</i>) is an ailment that soon subsides or breaks
into an ulcer. The ‘skilful’ professed to cure it in
the following manner, and no doubt when the swelling
subsided, as in most cases it did, the whole credit
was given to their magic ceremony. On Friday
(on which day alone the ceremony was efficacious)
certain magic words were muttered to the blade of
a knife or axe (the more steel the better), which was
held for the purpose close to the mouth, and then,
the blade being applied to the sore place, the swelling
was crossed and parted into nine, or other odd
numbers or imaginary divisions. After each crossing,
the axe was pointed towards a hill, the name of
which commences not with <i>ben</i>, a lofty hill, but <i>mam</i>,
a round mountain. For instance, in Mull and neighbourhood,
the malady was transferred (<i>do chuids’ air</i>,
<i>tha sid air</i>, <i>do roinn-sa air</i>, etc.) to <i>Màm Lìrein</i>, <i>Màm
an t-snòid</i>, <i>Màm Doire Dhubhaig</i>, <i>Màm Chlachaig</i>,
<i>Màm Bhrathadail</i>, etc., all hills in that island. When
the swelling was ‘counted’ (<i>air àireamh</i>) the axe was
pointed to the ground, saying, “the pain be in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
ground and the affliction in the earth” (<i>a ghoimh
san làr, ’s a chrádh san talamh</i>).</p>

<h3>LUMBAGO (<i>Leum droma</i>).</h3>

<p>When the back is strained and its nerves are
affected so that motion is painful, the afflicted person is
to lie down on his face, and one who was born feet
foremost is to step thrice across him, each time
laying his full weight on the foot that treads on
the patient’s back. There is no cure unless the person
stepping across has been born feet foremost.</p>

<h3>CONSUMPTION (<i>Caitheamh</i>).</h3>

<p>On the farm of Crossapol in Coll there is a stone
called <i>Clach Thuill</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the Hole Stone, through which
persons suffering from consumption were made to pass
three times in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost. They took meat with them each time, and left
some on the stone. The bird that took the food away
had the consumption laid upon it. Similar stones,
under which the patient can creep, were made use of in
other islands.</p>

<h3>LEPROSY (<i>Mùr</i>).</h3>

<p>The waterfall at Scorrybreck, near Portree in Skye,
called <i>Easa suc Con</i>, forms in the rock a natural trough
or basin about the length and breadth of a man. A
daughter of Lochlin, suffering from an incurable skin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
disease (<i>mùr</i>, leprosy?), in the course of her journeys in
search of a cure (there being a prophecy that her cure
was to be found in a northern island), came to this
waterfall. The trough was emptied, and she was
placed lying in it. She lay there till it again filled,
and her cure was effected.</p>

<h3><i>Loch Ma Nàr</i>,</h3>

<p class="noindent">in Sutherlandshire, if entered on the first Monday of
August, was believed to cure any and every disease or
sickness.</p>

<h3>WELLS.</h3>

<p>Throughout the Highlands there are wells to which
wonderful powers in the healing of disease were ascribed
in olden times. They were generally, but not always,
called after some saint, and their waters were drunk on
certain days or at a particular hour of the day and
with certain ceremonies and offerings. The importance
of these wells and the pilgrimages to them disappeared
with the Roman Catholic religion, and hardly a trace
now remains of their former honours beyond the name.</p>

<p>“The well of the Fian flag-stone” (<i>Tobar Leac nam
Fiann</i>) in Jura cured every disease. When the sick
person went to it he had to leave in it a pin, a needle,
a button, or other article, and if this was afterwards
taken away there was no cure.</p>

<p>In a cave beyond Sanna in Ardnamurchan, and near
the village of <i>Plòcaig</i>, there was about thirty years ago<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
a hole, holding about a bowlful, made in the floor of
the cave by water dripping from the roof. The waters
of this receptacle were decreed of great efficacy in
making those who drank it gay and strong. It was in
request by young men of a lively disposition, women
rising from childbed, etc. When entering, a copper
coin, a metal button, or a nail, was placed somewhere
near the door, and unless this was done it was not
safe to enter. At the time mentioned the shelves of
the cave were full of these offerings.</p>

<p>In North Uist, between Loch Maddy and Dïusa in
Merivale, there is a well that cures the toothache. In
the islet of St. Cormick, on the east of Cantyre, there
was a well that cured the jaundice till an old wife from
Breadalbane asked the saint in rude or uncivil terms
to cure her distemper (<i>vide</i> Old Statistical Account).</p>

<p>In Coll, near the <i>tung</i> or family burying-ground of
the M’Leans of Coll, there is a well called “the well
of stones” (<i>tobar nan clach</i>), and not far from it a
sunken rock in the sea called <i>Cairgein</i>. It was a
saying that as long as a person got water from the
one and dulse from the other he need never die of
want.</p>

<p>At the back of Hough Hill, in Tiree, there is a well
called “the well of the nine living” (<i>Tobar na naoi bèo</i>),
which in a season of great scarcity supported a widow
and her eight children without any nourishment but
itself and shellfish. Hence its name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<h3>PLANTS AND TREES. MOUNTAIN ASH.</h3>

<p>The efficacy of the wicken tree against witches,
already described, was a widespread belief, found in
England as well as in the Highlands, where it was also
said to make the best rod for a fisherman. If he takes
with him</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">he is most likely to be in luck. The reason is that no
evil or envious eye will rest upon himself or his equipments
(<i>cha laidh sùil orra</i>).</p>

<h3>PEARLWORT (<i>Mòthan</i>).</h3>

<p>The Trailing Pearlwort (<i>Sagina procumbens</i>), which
grows in very dry places and on old walls, was one of
the most efficacious plants against the powers of darkness.
This efficacy was attributed to its being the first
plant trodden on by Christ when He came on earth.
Placed on the lintel of the door (<i>san àrd dorus</i>), it kept
the spirits of the dead, if they returned, from entering
the house. If in the bull’s hoof, at the time of being
with the cow, the offspring’s milk could not be taken
away by witches. When placed below the right knee
of a woman in labour, it defeated the machinations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the fairy women. It must be pulled with certain
words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I will pull the pearlwort,</div>

</div>

<h3>ST. JOHN’S WORT (<i>Achlasan Challum Chille</i>).</h3>

<p>The Gaelic name of the Upright St. John’s Wort
(<i>hypericum pulchrum</i>) means literally St. Columba’s
axillary one. Why so called does not appear. To be
of use it must be found when neither sought for nor
wanted. If sought for, it has no efficacy more than
another plant, but if accidentally fallen in with, and
preserved, it wards off fever and keeps its owner from
being taken away in his sleep by the Fairies. One
version of the rhyme to be said in pulling it is in these
words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The axillary plant of Colum-Cill,</div>

<span class="smaller">DEATH WARNINGS.</span></h2>

<p>Death has always been deemed the greatest evil
that afflicts humanity, and the terrors and awe which
its advent inspires have given superstition its amplest
scope. The “King of Terrors” no doubt throws its
shadows before it, but that foreshadowing belongs to
medical diagnosis. The superstition connected with
it consists in making unusual appearances and natural
phenomena, having no relation to it beyond an accidental
proximity in time, forerunners of its dread
approach. The mind loves to dwell on the circumstances
connected with the death of a departed and
dear friend, and amid a sparse population, death is
not an event of that frequency and daily occurrence
which make it to the townsman little heeded, till it
affects himself and his friends. Besides, doubt and
scepticism are not spontaneous in the human mind,
and whenever any one states positively that he saw
supernatural indications connected with the death or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
spirit of one departed, he naturally and readily finds
credence. By being frequently told the tale becomes
more and more certain, and traditions, once they
have attained the rank of beliefs, are very slow
in dying out. That the excitable and imaginative
mind of the Celt should, therefore, have a firm belief
in supernatural fore-warnings of death is not at all
surprising.</p>

<p>Certain families and septs had death-warnings
peculiar to themselves, and whenever any of them
was on his death-bed, particularly when the death of
a chief was at hand, some one about the house was
sure to see or hear the warning. Before the death
of any of the Breadalbane family, the descendants
of Black Duncan of the Cowl (<i>Donncha du a
churraichd</i>), a bull was heard at night roaring up the
hillside. The bellowing grew fainter as it ascended
the mountain, and died away as it reached the top.
The origin of this superstition probably is, that Black
Duncan is accused of having once had a bull’s head
brought in at a feast as a signal for the massacre of
a number of the M’Gregors, whom he had invited in
a friendly manner to the castle. The clan Maclachlan
were warned of death by the appearance of a little
bird; a sept of the M’Gregors, known as the children
or descendants of Black Duncan (<i>Clann Dhonncha
dhui</i>), by a whistle; another family of the same
clan, “the children of little Duncan” (<i>Clann<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Dhonncha bhig</i>), by a light like that of a candle.
Other signals were shouting (<i>sgairt</i>), cries of distress,
screaming (<i>sgriachail</i>), sounds of weeping, etc. When
any of them foreboded death, it was heard where no
human being could be, and there was an unearthly
tone about it that struck a chill into the hearer’s
heart.</p>

<p>Before the death of a duine wassal (<i>duin uasal</i>, a
gentleman), a light or meteor called <i>Dreag</i> or rather
<i>Driug</i>, was seen in the sky proceeding from the
house to the grave in the direction in which the
funeral procession was to go. It was only for ‘big
men,’ people of station and affluence, that these lights
appeared, and an irreverent tailor once expressed a
wish that the whole sky were full of them.</p>

<h3>HUGH OF THE LITTLE HEAD (<i>Eoghan a chinn bhig</i>).</h3>

<p>This was the best known and most dreadful spectre
in the West Highlands, the phantom of a headless
horseman, which made its appearance whenever any
of the Maclaines of Lochbuy, in Mull, were near
their dissolution. The spectral horseman is mounted
on a small black steed, having a white spot on its
forehead, and the marks of the hoofs of which are
not like those of other horses, but round indentations
as if it had wooden legs. Whenever any of
the sept which he follows are on their death-bed
Hugh is heard riding past the house, and sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
even shows himself at the door. He does not sit
straight on his horse’s back, but somewhat to one
side, and the appearance of the almost headless body
is that of a water-stoup tied on the horse’s back.
The history of the man who is thus doomed to
attend at the death of any of his clan is curious.
Tradition is not always uniform on the subject, but
the following statement reconciles most of the accounts
and substantially agrees with them all.</p>

<p>Hugh was the only son of Hector the Stubborn
(<i>Eachunn Reuganach</i>), first chief of Lochbuy, in the
fourteenth century, and brother of Lachlan the Wily
(<i>Lachunn Lùbanach</i>), first chief of Dowart. He got
the name of “Hugh of the Little Head” in his lifetime,
and from the actions ascribed to him fully
bears his own testimony to the truth of the adage,
“A big head on a wise man and a hen’s head on
a fool” (<i>Ceann mōr air duine glic ’s ceann circ avi
amadan</i>). Sayings of his, which tradition has preserved,
illustrate the curious shrewdness sometimes
found in connection with limited intellect. Thus,
when his mother was being carried for burial, he
thought the pall-bearers were carrying the body too
high, and he told them not to raise her so high,
“in case she should seek to make a habit of it”
(<i>mu ’m bi i ’g iarraidh a chleachdaidh</i>), and the phrase
has since continued, “to seek to make a habit of
anything, like Hugh of the Little Head’s mother.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
He was married to a daughter of the house of
Macdougall of Lorn; and she proved but a very
indifferent wife. Tradition ascribes to her several
nicknames, all of them extremely opprobrious, “The
Black-bottomed Heron” (<i>Chorra thòn du</i>), “Stingy,
the Bad Black Heron” (<i>Gortag, an droch chorra dhu</i>),
“The Macdougall Heron” (<i>Curra Dhùghaill</i>), and
<i>Dubhag tòn ri teallaich</i>. He was a fearless soldier,
and altogether a very likely person to have been
made a wandering spectre of after his death.</p>

<p>Lochbuy first belonged to the Macfadyens. Maclaine
(so the family spell the name) having obtained a
grant of the place from the Lord of the Isles, deceitfully
asked Macfadyen for a site for a sheep-fold (<i>crò
chaoraich</i>), and, having obtained a hillock for the
purpose, proceeded to build a castle. When the
place was sufficiently fortified he shot an arrow from
it at Macfadyen, who sat at some distance picking
bones (<i>spioladh chnàmh</i>) at his dinner. In the end
Macfadyen had to leave his own land and go to
Garmony (<i>Gar’moin’ an fhraoich</i>), where he supported
himself by coining gold, gathered in <i>Beinn an Aoinidh</i>,
Mull, whence his descendants became known as “the
Seed of the Goldsmith’s” (<i>Siòlachadh nan òr-cheard</i>).
After this Lochbuy and Dowart quarrelled. The properties
of the two brothers adjoined, and between them
lay a piece of ground, the ownership of which they
disputed. A ploughman belonging to Lochbuy was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
ploughing on the debateable ground, when a friend of
Dowart, who was out hunting, shot him. Sometime
after this Dowart’s two boys were on a visit to Lochbuy,
whose wife, being a relative of the murdered
ploughman, went a piece of the way home with the
children, and at a well, since called “The Well of the
Heads” (<i>Tobar nan ceann</i>), took off their heads and
threw them into the well, leaving the bodies on the
bank. For this foul deed a deadly feud sprang up
between the two houses, and Hugh’s wife, being a
foster-sister (<i>co-dhalta</i>) of Dowart’s wife, did not care
though her husband and the house of Lochbuy should
be worsted.</p>

<p>This feud, joined to the other grievances of the
“Crane,” led to there being so little peace at Lochbuy
that the old chief gave Hugh a separate establishment,
and allotted to him the lands of Morinish. Hugh built
himself a castle on an islet in <i>Loch Sguabain</i>, a small
lake between Lochbuy and Dowart. His wife urged
him to go and get the rights (<i>còiricheaa</i>), <i>i.e.</i> the title
deeds, of the lands of Lochbuy, or perhaps to go and
get more, from his father, and at last he went. It
was explained to him that on his father’s death he
would have a right to the whole property, and he went
away pacified. His wife, however, urged that it would
be a small thing for Lachlan the Wily, his father’s
brother, to come and take from him everything he had.
He went again, an altercation ensued, and he struck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
his aged father a violent blow on the side of the head.
This came to the ears of the old man’s brother, the
chief of Dowart. Glad of an excuse to cut off the
heir presumptive and make himself master of Lochbuy,
and gratify his desire for revenge, Dowart collected his
men and marched to take Hugh to some place of confinement
or kill him. Hugh collected his own men
and prepared to give battle.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the fight, others say the
evening before, Hugh was out walking, and at the
boundary stream (<i>allt crìche</i>) saw an Elfin woman
rinsing clothes, and singing the “Song of the
M’Leans.”<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Her long breasts, after the manner of
her kind (according to the Mull belief regarding these
weird women), hung down and interfered with her
washing, and she now and then flung them over her
shoulders to keep them out of the way. Hugh crept
up silently behind her, and catching one of the breasts,
as is recommended in such cases, put the nipple in
his mouth, saying, “Yourself and I be witness you are
my first nursing mother.” She answered, “The hand
of your father and grandfather be upon you! You had
need that it is so.” He then asked her what she was
doing. She said, “Washing the shirts of your mortally-wounded
men” (<i>Nigheadh leintean nam fir ghointe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
agad-sa</i>), or (as others say) “the clothes of those who
will mount the horses to-morrow and will not return”
(<i>aodach nam fear theid air na h-eich a màireach ’s nach
till</i>). He asked her, “Will I win the fight?” She
answered that if he and his men got “butter without
asking” (<i>Im gun iarraidh</i>) to their breakfast, he would
win; if not, he would lose. He asked if he himself
would return alive from the battle (<i>an d’thig mise as
beò?</i>), and she either answered ambiguously or not at
all; and when going away left him as her parting gift
(<i>fāgail</i>) that he should go about to give warning of
approaching death to all his race. The same morning
he put on a new suit, and a servant woman coming in
just as he had donned it, praised it, and said, “May you
enjoy and wear it” (<i>Meal is caith e</i>). It was deemed
unlucky that a woman should be the first to say this,
and Hugh replied to the evil omen by saying, “May you
not enjoy your health” (<i>Na na meal thusa do shlàinte</i>).</p>

<p>For breakfast, “Stingy, the Black Heron,” sent in
curds and milk in broad dishes. She did not even
give spoons, but told Hugh and his men to put on
hen’s bills (<i>gobun cheare</i>) and take their food. Hugh
waited long to see if any butter would come, rubbing
his shoes together impatiently, saying now and then it
was time to go, and giving every hint he could that the
butter might be sent in. At last he threw his shoe
down the house, exclaiming, “Neither shoes nor speech
will move a bad housewife” (<i>Cha ghluais bròg no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
bruidhinn droch bhean tighe</i>), and demanding the butter.
“Send down the butter, and you may eat it yourself
to-morrow” (<i>cuir anuas an t-ìm, ’s feudaidh tu fhein
itheadh a màireach</i>). She retorted, “The kicker of old
shoes will not leave skin upon palm” (<i>Cha’n fhàg
breabadair na seana-bhròig craicionn air dearnaidh</i>).
When the butter came, Hugh said he did not want
her curds or cheese to be coming in white masses
through his men’s sides (<i>tighinn na staoigean geala roi’
chliathach nam fear aige</i>), kicked open the milk-house
door and let in the dogs, and went away, leaving the
breakfast untouched. The fight took place at <i>Onoc
nan Sgolb</i>, at the back of Innsri (<i>cùl na h-Innsribh</i>),
near <i>Ceann a Chnocain</i>, and not far from Torness in
Glenmore. As might be expected of fasting men,
Hugh and his followers lost the fight. The sweep of
a broadsword took off the upper part of his head
(<i>copan a chinn</i>). Instead of falling dead, he jumped
on the top of his horse, a small black steed with a
white spot on its forehead, and ever since is “dreeing
his weird” by going about to give warning when any
of his race are about to die.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>The ghostly rider of the black horse (<i>marcaich an
eich dhui</i>), crosses the seas in discharging his task.
When coming to Tiree (where there are now but
two or three persons claiming to be of the sept of
the Lochbuy Maclaines), he takes his passage from
<i>Port-nan-amhn’</i> near <i>Ru-an-t-sléibh</i>, in Treshinish,
Mull. About fifty years ago a Mull woman, living
there, insisted that she had often, when a young
woman, heard him galloping past the house in the
evening and had seen the sparks from his horse’s
hoofs as he rode down to the shore on his way to
Tiree.</p>

<p>It is told of an old man of the Lochbuy Macleans
in Tiree, that on his death-bed the noise of a horse
clanking a chain after it, was heard coming to the
house. Thinking it was Hugh of the Little Head,
he said, “The rider of the Black Horse is clanking
on his own errand” (<i>straoilich air ceann a ghnothuich
fhein</i>). On looking out the awe-struck company
found the noise was caused by a farm-horse dragging
a chain tether (<i>langasaid</i>) after it.</p>

<p>On the high road between Calachyle and Salen
in Mull, a strong man of the name of Maclean was
met at night by Hugh. The horseman spake never
a word, but caught Maclean to take him away.
Maclean resisted, and in the struggle caught hold of
a birch sapling and succeeded in holding it till the
cock crew. The birch tree was twisted in the struggle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
and one after another of its roots gave way. As
the last was yielding the cock crew. The twisted
tree may still be seen. The same story is told of a
twisted tree near Tobermory, and a similar one is
localised between Lochaber and Badenoch.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Other premonitions of death were the howling of
dogs, the appearance of lights, loud outcries and
sounds of weeping, apparitions of the doomed person’s
“fetch,” or coffin, or funeral procession, etc. These
sounds and appearances were more apt to precede
an accidental and premature death, such as drowning,
and to understand them properly it will be necessary
to enter into an examination of the doctrine of the
Second Sight.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="smaller">SECOND SIGHT (<i>an da shealladh</i>).</span></h2>

<p>Freed from a good deal of mystery in which an
imperfect understanding of its character has involved
it, the gift of second sight may be briefly explained
to be the same as being “spectre-haunted,” or liable
to “spectre illusions,” when that condition occurs, as
it often does, in persons of sound mind. The phenomena
in both cases are the same; the difference is
in the explanation given of them. In the one case
the vision is looked on as unreal and imaginary,
arising from some bodily or mental derangement,
and having no foundation in fact, while the other
proceeds on a belief that the object seen is really
there and has an existence independent of the seer,
is a revelation, in fact, to certain gifted individuals
of a world different from, and beyond, the world
of sense. Science has accepted the former as the true
and rational explanation, and traces spectral illusions
to an abnormal state of the nervous system, exhaustion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
of mind or body, strong emotions, temperament,
and others of the countless, and at times obscure,
causes that lead to hallucination and delusion. But
before optical and nervous delusions were recognised
by science, while the spectres were believed to be
external realities having an existence of their own,
the visions were necessarily invested with an awe
approaching to terror, and the gift or faculty of
seeing them could not but be referred to some such
explanation as the doctrine of the second sight offers.</p>

<p>“The shepherds of the Hebrid Isles” are usually
credited with the largest possession of the gift, but
the doctrine was well known over the whole Highlands,
and as firmly believed in Ross-shire and the
highlands of Perthshire as in the remotest Hebrides.
Waldron describes it as existing in his time in the
Isle of Man. It is a Celtic belief, and the suggestion
that it is the remains of the magic of the
Druids is not unreasonable. In every age there are
individuals who are spectre-haunted, and it is probable
enough that the sage Celtic priests, assuming the
spectres to be external, reduced the gift of seeing
them to a system, a belief in which formed part of
their teaching. This accounts for the circumstance
that the second sight has flourished more among the
Celts than any other race.</p>

<p>The Gaelic name <i>da-shealladh</i> does not literally
mean “the second sight,” but “the two sights.” The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
vision of the world of sense is <i>one</i> sight, ordinarily
possessed by all, but the world of spirits is visible
only to certain persons, and the possession of this
additional vision gives them “the two sights,” or
what comes to the same thing, “a second sight.”
Through this faculty they see the ghosts of the dead
revisiting the earth, and the fetches, doubles, or
apparitions of the living.</p>

<p>The world to which apparitions belong is called by
writers on the second sight “the world of spirits,” but
the expression does not convey correctly the idea
attached to visions of the kind. The object seen,
usually that of a friend or acquaintance, the phantasm,
phantom, apparition, or whatever else we choose to call
it, was recognised to be as independent of the person
whose semblance it bore as it was of the person seeing
it. He knew nothing of the phantom’s appearance, it
was not his spirit, and played its part without his
knowledge or his wish. The seer, again, could not,
or did not, trace it to anything in himself; it did not
arise from any suggestion of his hopes or fears, and was
not a reproduction of any former state of his mind or
thought. As to its owing its origin to anything
abnormal in himself, he was (as far as he could
judge) as healthy in mind and body as other people.
As long, therefore, as men believed the phantasm to
be an external reality, they were compelled to believe
in doubles, or semblances, that move in a world which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
is neither that of sense nor that of spirits. The actions
and appearances of these doubles have no counterpart
in any past or present event, and naturally are referred
to the future and the distant.</p>

<p>The object seen, or phantasm, is called <i>taibhs</i> (pron.
<i>taïsh</i>), the person seeing it <i>taibhsear</i> (pron. <i>taïsher</i>), and
the gift of vision, in addition to its name of second
sight, is known as <i>taibhsearachd</i>. It is noticeable that
many words referring to spirits and ghosts begin with
this syllable <i>ta</i>. The following are worth noticing:</p>

<p><i>Tannas</i>, or <i>tannasg</i>, a spectre, generally of the dead,
and in the idea attached to it more shadowy, unsubstantial,
and spiritual than a <i>Bòchdan</i>.</p>

<p><i>Tamhasg</i> (pron. <i>taüsg</i>), the shade or double of a
living person, is the common name for apparitions by
which men are haunted, and with which, according to
the doctrine of the second sight, they have to hold
assignations.</p>

<p><i>Tàchar</i>, a rare and almost obsolete word, but the
derivatives of which, <i>tacharan</i> and <i>tachradh</i>, are still in
common use. The only instances known to the writer
of its occurrence are in the names of places. <i>Sròn an
tàchair</i>, the Ghost-haunted Nose, is a rock between
Kinloch Rannoch and Druim-a-chastail, in Perthshire,
where faint mysterious noises were heard, and on
passing which the wayfarer was left by the mysterious
sprite which joined him in the hollow below. <i>Imire
tàchair</i>, in the island of Iona, is a ridge leading from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
near the ecclesiastical buildings to the hill, and, till the
moor through which it runs was drained in recent
years, formed an elevation above a sheet of water,—a
very likely place to have been haunted by goblins.
The natives of the island have no tradition or explanation
of the name. The derivatives <i>tachradh</i> and
<i>tacharan</i> are applied to a weak and helpless person:
when the first syllable is long, in pity; when short,
contemptuously, as, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>an tăchradh grànda</i>, “the
ugly wretch.”</p>

<p><i>Tàslaich</i>, a supernatural premonition, felt or heard,
but not seen. Also applied to the ghosts of the living.
For instance, a native of Skye being asked the reason
why dogs were barking at night near a churchyard, said
it was because they saw <i>tàslaich nan daoine beò</i>, the
ghosts of the living, the premonition of a funeral.</p>

<p><i>Tàradh</i>, noises (<i>straighlich</i>) heard at night through
the house, indicating a change of tenants, a premonition
by mysterious sounds of a coming event.</p>

<p><i>Taran</i>, the ghost of an unbaptised child (Dr. Macpherson,
p. 307), not now a common word.</p>

<p><i>Tàsg</i>, perhaps a contraction of <i>tamhasg</i>, used
commonly in the expression <i>eigheach tàisg</i>, the cry
or wail of a fetch. Cf. <i>taghairm</i>, the spirit-call.</p>

<p>The whole doctrine of these apparitions of the living,
or, as they are called in Cumberland, <i>swarths</i>, and premonitions
of coming events, proceeds on the supposition
that people have a counterpart or other self, an <i>alter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
ego</i>, which goes about unknown to themselves, with
their voices, features, form, and dress, even to their
shoes, and is visible to those who have the unhappy
gift of the second sight. This phantasm, or other self,
is not the life or the spirit of the person whom it
represents. He has nothing to do with it; he may,
at the time it is seen, be sunk in unconscious sleep, or
his attention and wishes may be otherwise taken up,
and death may not be at all in his thoughts. At the
same time, it is not without some connection with him.
Strongly wishing is apt to make one’s <i>tàradh</i> be heard
at the place where he wishes to be, and if the person
whose spectre is seen be spoken to the apparition disappears;
but in general the <i>taibhs</i> is independent of
all thought, or action, or emotion of the person whom
it represents. The doctrine does not assert that all
men have got such a double, much less that those who
are most largely gifted with the second sight see it
always, or even frequently. The spectres are visible
to the seer only under exceptional circumstances, in
certain situations, and at certain times. The most
usual of these are after dusk and across a fire, when a
sudden or violent death has occurred, or is to occur,
when a friend is ill, when strangers are to come, or
any event is impending calculated to make a deep
impression on the mind.</p>

<p>Spectres are often seen with as much distinctness as
external objects, and it would be a great injustice to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the poor man, who claims to have visions of things
that are not there at all, to say he is telling an untruth.
To him the vision is really there, and it is but natural
for him to think it has an existence separate from himself,
instead of referring it to an abnormal state of his
mind and nervous system. Some spectres “move with
the moving eye,” being what the poet calls “hard
mechanic ghosts”; others have their own proper motion,
and probably arise in the brain. The former are the
most common, and it was a test among <i>taïshers</i>, whether
the figure seen was a wraith or not, to stoop down and
raise themselves up again suddenly. If the figure did
the same, it was an apparition, a <i>tamhasg</i>.</p>

<p>The gift of second sight was not in any case looked
upon as enviable or desirable. Seers frequently expressed
a wish that they had no such gift. In some
instances it ran in the family; in others, but rarer
cases, the seer was the only one of his kindred who
“saw sights” (<i>chì sealladh</i>). Some had it early in life,
upon others it did not come till they were advanced in
life. These characteristics alone show it to be in its
origin the same as spectral illusions. It arose from
hereditary disease, malformation, or weakness of the
visual organs, and derangements of mind or bodily
health. It was not <i>voluntary</i>; the visions went and
came without the option of the seer, and his being
visited by them was deemed by himself and others a
misfortune rather than a gift. A difference was also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
recognised in the kinds of apparitions visible to different
individuals.</p>

<p>When the figure of an acquaintance was seen, the
manner in which the <i>taibhs</i> was clothed afforded an
indication to the skilful seer of the fate then befalling,
or about to befall, the person whose <i>taibhs</i> it was. If
the apparition was dressed in the dead-clothes, the
person was to die soon; but if in every-day clothes,
his death would not occur for some time. If the
clothes covered the entire face, his death would be very
soon; if the face was uncovered, or partly covered,
death was proportionately more remote. Others saw
the dead-clothes first about the head, and lower down
at each succeeding vision. When the feet were covered
death was imminent. There were, however, grave-clothes
of good fortune (<i>lion-aodach àigh</i>) as well as
grave-clothes indicative of death (<i>lion-aodach bàis</i>), and
it was considered extremely difficult for the most skilful
seer to distinguish between them. He required, he
said, a close view of the spectre to tell which it
had on.</p>

<p>The time of day at which the vision was seen was
also an indication. The later in the day, the sooner
the death. If as late as 5 p.m., soon; but if as early
as 2 a.m., the man might live for years.</p>

<p>If the person seen was to be drowned at sea, phosphorescent
gleams (<i>teine-sionnachain</i>), such as are common
in the Hebridean seas on summer nights, appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
round the figure, or its clothes seemed to drip, or there
was water in its shoes.</p>

<p>The <i>swarths</i>, or doubles, were believed to go through
all the actions and occupy the places which the originals
would afterwards perform or occupy. This was particularly
the case with regard to funerals. They went
for the glasses to be used on the occasion, for the coffin,
and even for the wood to make it, and marched in
melancholy procession to the churchyard. When the
funeral procession was seen, the seer was unable to say,
except by inference, whose funeral it was. For anything
he could directly tell, it might be, as it sometimes
was, his own. He could only tell the dress, position in
the procession, and appearance of those performing the
sad duty. It is dangerous to walk in the middle of the
road at night, in case of meeting one of these processions,
and being thrown down or forced to become one
of the coffin-bearers to the graveyard. Persons in the
latter predicament have experienced great difficulty in
keeping on the road, the whole weight of the coffin
seeming to be laid upon them, and pushing them off
the path. If the seer goes among the swarths he will
likely be knocked down, but in some districts, as
Moidart, he is said to have one of the staves or bearers
(<i>lunn</i>) of the coffin thrust into his hand, and to be compelled
to take his part in the procession till relieved in
due time. In Durness, in Sutherlandshire, the cry of
“Relief!” there used at every change of coffin-bearers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
has been heard at night by persons whose houses were
near the high-road called out by the phantasms in their
ghostly procession. Persons have been caught hold of
by those reputed to have the second sight, and pulled
to a side to allow a spectral funeral to pass; and it was
universally believed that when the seer saw a procession
of the kind, or, indeed, any of his supernatural visions,
he could make others see the same sight by putting his
foot on theirs and a hand on their shoulder. He
should, therefore, never walk in the middle of the road
at night. Taïshers never did so. At any moment the
traveller may fall in with a spectral funeral, and be
thrown down or seized with the oppression of an
unearthly weight.</p>

<p>The visions of the seer did not always relate to
melancholy events, impending death, funerals, and misfortunes.
At times he had visions of pleasant events,
and saw his future wife, before he ever thought of her
(at least so he said), sitting by the fireside in the seat
she was afterwards to occupy. He could tell whether
an absent friend was on his way home, and whether he
was to have anything in his hands when coming. He
could not tell what the thing was to be, but merely the
general appearance of the absent man when returning,
and whether he was to come full or empty handed.</p>

<p>It has been said that the phantasm (<i>taibhs</i> or
<i>tamhasg</i>) was independent of all thought and volition
on the part of those whom it represented, as well as on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the part of the seer himself. At the same time, it was
part of the creed that if the person whose double was
seen was spoken to and told to cease his persecutions,
the annoyance came to an end. The person spoken
to, being utterly unconscious that his phantasm was
wandering about and annoying any one, got very
angry, but somehow the spectre ceased to appear.
Before taking a final leave, however, it gave the person
whom it had haunted (as an informant described it)
“one thundering lashing.” After that it was no more
seen.</p>

<p>When a double is first met, if it be taken to be the
man himself whose semblance it bears, and be spoken
to, it acquires the power of compelling the person who
has accosted it to hold nightly assignations with it in
future. The man, in fact, from that hour becomes
“spectre-haunted.” Hence it was a tenet of the second
sight never to be the first to speak, on meeting an
acquaintance at night, till satisfied that the figure seen
was of this world. The seer did not like, indeed did
not dare, to tell to others whose figure it was that
haunted him. If he did so, the anger of the spectre
was roused, and on the following evening it gave him a
dreadful thrashing. When he resisted, he grasped but
a shadow, was thrown down repeatedly in the struggle,
and bruised severely. This form of the disease was well
known in the Western Islands. The haunted person,
as in the case of those who had Fairy sweethearts, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
to leave home at a certain hour in the evening to meet
the spectre, and if he dared for one night to neglect the
assignation he received in due course a sound thrashing.
Sometimes at these meetings the spectre spoke and
gave items of information about the death of the seer
and others. Ordinarily, however, it had merely an
indistinct murmuring kind of speech (<i>tormanaich
bruidhinn</i>).</p>

<p>People noted for the second sight have been observed
to have a peculiar look about the eyes. One of them,
for instance, in Harris was described as “always looking
up and never looking you straight in the face.”
Those who are of a brooding, melancholy disposition
are most liable to spectral illusions, and it is only to
be expected that the gloom of their character should
appear in their looks, and that many of their visions
should relate to deaths and funerals.</p>

<p>Among a superstitious and credulous people the
second sight, or a pretence to it, must have furnished a
powerful weapon of annoyance, and there is reason to
believe that, in addition to cases of nervous delusion
and of men being duped by their own fancies, there
were many instances of imposture and design. So
much, indeed, was this the case, that a person of
undoubted good character, born and brought up among
believers in the second sight, and himself not incredulous
on the subject, said: “I never knew a truthful,
trustworthy man (<i>duine fìrinneach creideasach</i>) who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
a taïsher.” While being spectre-haunted was honoured
by the name of a Second Sight, and was invested with
mystery and awe, no doubt many laid claim to it for
the sake of the awe with which it invested them to
annoy those whom they disliked, or to make capital
out of it with those anxious about the future or the
absent.</p>

<h3>SPECTRES OF THE LIVING (<i>Tamhasg</i>).</h3>

<p>Some thirty years ago a man in Tiree, nicknamed
the Poult (<i>am Big-ein</i>), was haunted for several months
by the spectre of the person with whom he was at the
time at service. The phantom came regularly every
evening for him, and if its call was disregarded it gave
him next evening a severe thrashing. According to the
man’s own account, the spectre sometimes spoke, and,
when he understood what it said, gave good advice.
Its speech was generally indistinct and unintelligible.
The person whose spectre it was, on being spoken to on
the subject, got very angry, but the visits of the spectre
ceased.</p>

<p>Only a few years ago a young man, also in Tiree,
was on his way home about midnight from the parish
mill, where he had been kiln-drying corn. He had to
go against a strong gale of north-west wind, and, having
his head bent down and not looking well before him,
ran up against a figure, which he took to be that of a
young man of his acquaintance. He spoke to it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the figure answered in broken, inarticulate speech
(<i>tormanaich bruidhinn</i>). Every evening afterwards
during that half-year he had to leave the house in
which he was at service to meet, he himself said, the
spectre that had thus met him. A person who doubted
this followed one evening, and saw him, immediately on
leaving the house, squaring out in boxing style to some
invisible opponent, and falling at every round. The
haunted youth said the apparition gave him much
information. It said the person whose semblance it
itself bore was to die of fever, that the coffin was to be
taken out of the house by certain individuals, whom it
named, and was to be placed on two creels outside the
door. On speaking to the lad whose apparition haunted
him, the persecution ceased. The common opinion was
that this was a case of imposture and design.</p>

<p>Near Salen, in Mull, a workman, when going home
from his employment in the evening, forgot to take his
coat with him. He returned for it, and the apparition
(<i>tamhasg</i>) of a woman met him, and gave him a squeezing
(<i>plùchadh</i>) that made him keep his bed for several
days.</p>

<p>In the same island a man was said to have been
knocked off his horse by an apparition.</p>

<p>A crofter (or tenant of a small piece of land of
which he has no lease) in Caolas, Tiree, went out at
night to see that his neighbour’s horses were not trespassing
on some clover he had in his croft. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
a man who had confessedly the second sight. He
observed on this occasion a man going in a parallel
direction to himself, and but a short distance off. At
first he thought it was only a neighbour, Black Allan,
trying to frighten him, but, struck by the motion and
silence of the figure, he stooped down, and then raised
himself suddenly. The figure did the same, proof of
its being a <i>tamhasg</i> or phantasm. The seer reached
home, pale and ready to faint, but nothing further came
of his vision.</p>

<p>Three years ago a man, who claims to have the
second sight, was on his way home at night to Barrapol,
in the west end of Tiree, from the mill (which is
in the centre of the island) with a sack of meal on his
back. He laid down the sack, and rested by the wayside.
When swinging the burden again on his shoulder
he observed a figure standing beside him, and then
springing on the top of the sack on his back. It
remained there, rendering the sack very oppressive,
till he reached home, some miles further on.</p>

<p>The son of a seer in Coll was away in the south
country. The seer when delving saw his son several
times lending assistance, and on two occasions when
coming home with a creelful of peats, after taking a
rest by the way, saw him helping to lift the creel again
on his back. Before long word came of his son’s
death.</p>

<p>Alexander Sinclair, from Erray, in Mull, was grieve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
at Funery in Morven. Two, if not three, of the
servant women fell in love with him. He had to cross
one night a bridge in the neighbourhood, between
Savory and Salachan, and was met by the apparitions
of two women, whom he recognised as his fellow-servants.
One, he said, was the figure of a dark little
woman, and lifted him over the parapet. The other
was that of the dairymaid, in the house in which he
was, and it rescued him. The adventure ended by his
marrying the dairymaid.</p>

<p>A man, going home at night to Ledmore (<i>Leudmòr</i>),
near Loch Frisa, in Mull, saw the kitchen-maid of the
house in which he was at service waiting for him on
the other side of a ford that lay in his way. Suspecting
the appearance, he went further up the stream to avoid
it, but it was waiting for him at every ford. At last
he crossed, and held on his way, the apparition accompanying
him. At the top of the first incline, the
apparition threw him down. He rose, but was again
thrown. He struggled, but the figure, he said, had no
weight, and he grasped nothing but wind. On the
highest part of the ascent, called <i>Guala Spinne</i>, the
apparition left him. After going home, the man spoke
to the woman whose spectre had met him. “The next
time,” he said, “you meet me, I will stab you.” This
made the woman cry, but he was never again troubled
by her apparition.</p>

<p>A native of Glenbeg in Ardnamurchan, Henderson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
by name, was at service in Kilfinichen in Mull. One
of the servant maids there made him a present of a
pair of worsted gloves. After returning home from
service, he had, one evening towards dusk (<i>am bial
an anmuich</i>, lit. in the mouth of lateness) to go
from Glenbeg to Kilchoan, by a path across a steep
incline on the side of the lofty Ben-shianta, towards the
projection known as “The Nose of the Macleans”
(<i>Sròin Chloinn Illeathain</i>). Steep mountain paths of
this kind are called <i>Catha</i>, and this particular catha is
called <i>Catha na Muice</i> (the pig’s pass). Near the top
of the ascent (<i>aonaich</i>), and where the difficult path
ceases (<i>bràighe na Catha</i>), there is a narrow step (<i>aisre</i>),
which only one person at a time can cross, leading
towards another ascent (<i>aonaich</i>). When going up the
first ascent, or cadha, Henderson was joined by the
apparition of the woman who had made him the gloves
in Kilfinichen. She was on the up side of him, and he
saw, when he came to the <i>aisre</i>, if she chose to give
him a push, he would be precipitated into the black
shore (<i>du-chladach</i>), which the rocks there overhang,
and become a shapeless bundle (<i>seirgein cuagach</i>). He
blessed himself, and taking courage crossed in safety.
When he got on more level ground, over towards
Correi-Vulin, he took the gloves she had given him,
and threw them at her, saying “that is all the
business you have with me.” He stayed that night in
<i>Laga Fliuch</i>, and next day went to Kilchoan. On his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
return he looked for the gloves, and saw them where
he had thrown them. He had no return of the vision.</p>

<h3>APPARITIONS OF THE DEAD.</h3>

<p>A taïsher in Tiree came upon a dead body washed
ashore by the sea. The corpse had nothing on in the
way of clothing but a pair of sea-boots. Old people
considered it a duty, when they fell in with a drowned
body, to turn it over or move it in some way. In this
case, the seer was so horrified that, instead of doing
this, he ran away. Other people, however, came, and
the body was duly buried. Afterwards the dead man
haunted the seer, and now and then appeared and
terrified him exceedingly. One night on his way
home he saw the corpse before him, wherever he
turned, and on reaching the house it stood between
him and the door. He walked on till close to the
house, and then called to his wife to take the broomstick
and sprinkle the door-posts with urine. When
this was done, he boldly walked forward. The spectre,
on his approach, leapt from the ground, and stood
above the door with a foot resting on each side on the
double walls. The seer entered between its legs, and
never saw the horrible apparition again.</p>

<p>A taïsher in Coll had no second sight till some
time after his marriage. Working one day with a
companion near the shore, he left for a short time, but
stayed away so long that, on his return, he was asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
what kept him? He said he had been looking at the
body of a drowned man, which the waves were swaying
backwards and forwards near the rocks. Others, however,
were of opinion he had found the body on the
shore, ransacked its clothes, and then thrown it again
into the sea, and that the second sight was a curse sent
upon him for the deed. Certain it is that from that
day he had the second sight. His friends at first
doubted him, when he said he saw visions, till he one
day told his sister a certain rope in the house would be
sent for before morning, to be used about a body lying
on the “straight-board.” This proved to be the case,
and his reputation as a taïsher was established.</p>

<p>A noted seer, named <i>Mac Dhòmhnuill Oig</i>, in Kilmoluag,
Tiree, was sitting one day at home, when his
brother entered, and opening a chest in the room, took
out some money. In reply to the seer’s inquiries, the
brother said he was going to pay such and such a
shoemaker for a pair of shoes recently got from him.
The brother died soon after, and the shoemaker claimed
the price of the shoes. The seer warmly resisted the
claim, as he himself had seen his brother taking the
money expressly to pay them. That same night, however,
he saw the shade of his deceased brother crossing
the room, and, as it were, fumbling in a particular place
on the top of the inner wall of the house. Next day
the seer himself searched in the same spot, and found
there the money that had been taken out of the chest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
to pay the shoes. He could only think it had been
placed there by his brother when alive, and had been
forgotten.</p>

<p>A taïsher, whose house was at Crossapol, where the
burying-ground of the island of Coll is, on his way home
from the harbour of Arnagour, about six miles away,
experienced many mischances (<i>driod-fhortain</i>), such as
falling, etc. He arrived at home to find his only
child, a boy about twelve years of age, dead in the
burying-ground, where he had gone to play and fallen
asleep. Its entrails (<i>màthair a mhionaich</i>) were protruding.
The seer, in his distraction, belaboured the
surrounding graves with his stick, accusing their
tenants, in his outcries, of indifference to him and his,
and saying he had many of his kindred among them,
though they had allowed this evil to befall his child.
That night a voice came to him in his sleep, saying,
he should not be angry with them (shades of the dead),
seeing they were away that day in Islay keeping
“strange blood” from the grave of Lachlan Mor
(<i>cumail na fuil choimhich a uaigh Lachuinn Mhòir</i>),
and were not present to have rescued the child. This
Lachlan Mor was a man of great stature and bodily
strength, chief of the Macleans of Dowart, and therefore
related to the Macleans of Coll, who had been
killed at the bloody clan battle of Gruinard Beach, in
Islay, and was buried at Kilchoman Churchyard. On
hearing of the seer’s vision the Laird of Coll dispatched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
a boat to Islay, and it was found that on the day the
child was murdered an attempt had been made to lift
the chief’s gravestone for the burial of a sailor, whose
body had been cast ashore on a neighbouring beach.
The attempt had failed, and the stone was left partly
on its edge (<i>air a leth-bhile</i>). The shades had laid
their weight upon it, so that it could not be moved
further.</p>

<p>This story the writer has heard more than once
adduced as positive proof of the reality of the second
sight (<i>tabhsearachd</i>), that is, of the capacity of some
men to see and hear spirits, or whatever else the
spectres are. The power of the dead to lay a heavy
weight upon persons as well as things, and even to
punish the living, is shown by the following stories.</p>

<p>In the same island of Coll the wife of Donald the
Fair-haired (<i>Dòmhnull Bàn</i>) was lying ill. She had
strange feelings of oppression and sickness (<i>tinneas ’us
slachdadh</i>). Donald’s father was a taïsher, and came to
see her. After sitting and watching for some time he
told her she had herself to blame for her sickness, that
she must have done some act of unkindness or wrong
to her mother, and that her feelings of oppression were
caused by the spirit of her dead father coming and
lying its weight upon her. The seer professed to see
the spirit of the dead leaning its weight upon the sick
person.</p>

<p>A woman (the tale, which comes from Perthshire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
does not say where), being ill-treated by her husband,
wished, too strongly and unduly, her brother, who had
some time previously died in Edinburgh, were with her
to take her part. Soon after, when she was alone, her
brother’s shade appeared, and in a tone of displeasure
asked her what was wrong, and what she wanted him
for. She told. Her husband was at the time ploughing
in a field in front of the house. The woman saw
the shade going towards him, and when it reached, her
husband fell dead.</p>

<h3>STRONG AND UNDUE WISHES.</h3>

<p>It is in fact part of the creed in the Second Sight
that a person should never indulge in strong wishes,
lest he overstep proper bounds, and wish what Providence
has not designed to be. Such wishes affect
others, especially if these others have anything of the
Second Sight.</p>

<p>A woman in the island of Harris, known as <i>Fionnaghal
a Mhoir</i>, was celebrated for her gift of Second
Sight. A young man related to her went to Appin,
in Argyleshire, with a boat. One day, when taking a
smoke, he expressed a wish that <i>Fionnaghal a Mhoir</i>
had a draw of his pipe. Next day, and long before it
could be known in Harris the youth had expressed
such a wish, Flora, daughter of the Big Man (for that
is the meaning of her name), told her friends that a
pipe was being offered her all night by the young man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
and that she was anxious enough to have a smoke
from it, but could not.</p>

<p>A young girl in Kennovay, Tiree, holding a bowl
of milk in her hands, expressed a wish a certain
woman (naming one, who was a <i>taibhsear</i>) had the
bowl to drink. Next day the woman indicated in
the wish told the girl she had a sore time of it all
night keeping the bowl away from her lips.</p>

<p>In very recent times, not above four years ago,
as the driver of the mail-gig was going through the
Wood of Nant (<i>Coill an Eannd</i>), between Bonawe and
Loch Awe, at night, he was met by the figure of his
sweetheart, and received from it such a severe thrashing
that he had to turn back. On telling this to herself,
afterwards, she acknowledged, that on the night referred
to she was very anxious about him, and wished she
could intercept him in case, at his journey’s end,
he should go to a house where fever had broken
out.</p>

<p>A woman in Lismore, making a bowl of gruel
(<i>brochan blàth</i>) in the evening, expressed a wish her
husband, who was then away at the fishing at Corpach,
near the entrance to the Caledonian Canal, had the
drink she was making. When her husband came
home, he said to her, “I tell you what it is, you are
not to come again with porridge to me at Corpach.”
He said he had seen her all night at his bedside
offering him his gruel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>The power ascribed to strong wishes, or rather the
evil consequences by which they may be followed, is
still more forcibly illustrated by the following tale.</p>

<p>A young woman at Barr, Morvern, beautiful and
much esteemed in her own neighbourhood, was about
to be married. Other maidens were in the house with
her, sewing the dresses for the marriage. As they sat
at work, she sighed and said, she wished her intended
was come. At that moment, he was on his way
coming over the shoulder of Ben Iadain, a lofty
mountain near hand, of weird appearance and having
the reputation of being much frequented by the Fairies.
He observed his sweetheart walking beside him, and as
the shadowy presence threw him down, he struck at it
repeatedly with his dirk. The bride got unwell, and,
before the bridegroom reached the house, died. The
‘fetch’ left him shortly before his arrival, and her death
was simultaneous with its disappearance.</p>

<p>It has been said that the appearance of the spectre
was considered entirely independent of the thoughts or
volition of the person whose image it bears. Yet the
tales of the Second Sight indicate some mysterious
connection between men and their doubles. Strongly
wishing, as in the above instances, causes at times a
person’s likeness to be seen or heard at the place where
he wishes to be, and the original (so to call him) may
be affected through his double.</p>

<p>A man in Islay encountered a ghost, and threw his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
open penknife at it. The weapon struck the phantom
in the eye, and at that moment, a woman, whose
likeness it bore, though several miles away, was struck
blind of an eye.</p>

<p>A young woman, residing in Skye, had a lover, a
sailor, who was away in the East Indies. On Hallowe’en
night she went, as is customary in country frolics,
to pull a kail plant, that she might know, from its
being crooked or straight or laden with earth, what the
character or appearance or wealth of her future husband
might be. As she grasped a stock to pull it,
a knife dropped from the sky and stuck in the plant.
When her lover came home, she learned from him, that
on that very night and about the same hour, he was
standing near the ship’s bulwark, looking over the side,
with a knife in his hand. He was thinking of her, and
in his reverie the knife fell out of his hand and over
the side. The young woman produced the knife she
found in the kail-stock, and it proved to be the very
knife her sailor lover had lost.</p>

<h3>TÀRADH.</h3>

<p>When a person strongly wishes to be anywhere, as
for instance when a person on a journey at night wishes
to be at home, his footsteps coming to the house, or
the sounds of his lifting the door latch are heard, or a
glimpse of his appearance is seen, at the time of his
conceiving or expressing the wish, and even without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
any wish being present to the absent person’s mind,
sights or sounds indicative of his coming may be seen
or heard. This previous intimation is called his <i>tàradh</i>,
and his double or shade, which is the cause of it, his
<i>tàslach</i>. These mysterious intelligences are also called
<i>manadh nan daoine bèo</i>, “the omens of living men.”
The family, sitting round the evening fire, hear a
footstep approaching the house, and even a tapping at
the door. The sounds are so life-like that some one
goes to open the door, but there is no one there. The
sound is only the <i>tàradh</i> of an absent friend, storm-tossed
or wayworn, and wishing he were at home.</p>

<p>The <i>tàradh</i> may be that of a complete stranger, who
is not thinking of, and perhaps does not even know
the place to which his <i>tàradh</i> has come. When there
is to be a change of tenants the advent of the stranger
is heralded, it may be years beforehand, by his double.
It is said “<i>thàinig a thàradh</i>,” <i>i.e.</i> his wraith or forewarning
has come. When a shepherd, for instance,
from another part of the country, is to come to a place,
his likeness, phantom, or <i>tàradh</i>, is seen perhaps years
beforehand on the hills he is afterwards so frequently
to traverse. It is not every kind of men who have this
phantom or double, neither does it appear wherein
those who have it differ from other men. At all events
if all men have it, it is not always to be seen.</p>

<p>A feeling of oppression at night, and the sound of
footsteps through the house and the noise of furniture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
being moved about, is the omen of a change of tenants,
and the <i>tàradh</i> of the incoming tenant.</p>

<p>In the island of Coll, the chiefs of which in former
times were among the most celebrated in the West
Highlands, and where the return of the former lairds is
talked about, and believed in, and prayed for among
the few of the native population left, the figure of the
Laird who is to come is said to have been seen by the
castle servants, sitting in an empty chair, with a long
beard flowing down to his breast.</p>

<p>A young man, sleeping alone in a house, in which a
shop was kept by his father at Scarinish, Tiree, one
night felt such an oppression on his chest that he could
not sleep, and heard noises as if there were people in
the house. He got up and made a thorough search,
but found no one. Before long there was a change in
the occupancy of the house.</p>

<p>On the uninhabited and lonely islet of <i>Fladdachuain</i>,
to the east of Skye, some storm-stayed fishermen
were boiling potatoes in a deserted bothy, and heard
the noise of voices outside. On going out they could
find no one. This occurred thrice. Some days after,
and before the fishermen got away, a boat passing to
the outer Hebrides was forced by stress of weather to
take refuge in the same islet. The voices of its crew
were exactly those previously heard. Nothing further
occurred in connection with the sounds.</p>

<p>The spirit, thus coming in a visible or audible form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
about a treasure, by which the thoughts are too much
occupied, or where a person wishes too much to be, is
also denominated “<i>falbh air fàrsaing</i>,” <i>i.e.</i> going
uncontrolled (?)</p>

<h3>MARRIAGE.</h3>

<p>Those gifted with the second sight were sometimes
able to tell the appearance of a person’s future wife.
They saw her taïsh, or appearance, sitting beside her
husband, and this long before the event occurred, or
was spoken of. For instance, a seer has been known
to remark to a young man, who did not dream of
marrying at the time, “I think your wife must belong
to a big house, for she has a white apron on,” etc.</p>

<p>The event has proved the vision to be real. The
woman was housemaid in a gentleman’s house.
Seers also said they saw their own future wives sitting
opposite to them at the fireside.</p>

<p>A native of Coll, Hugh, son of Donald the Red
(<i>Eoghan MacDhòmhnuill Ruaidh</i>), while serving with
his regiment in Africa, said he saw, almost every
evening, for a period of five years, glimpses of the
woman whom he afterwards married, and whom he
never saw in reality till his return from the wars.
Wherever he sat, after the day’s march, the figure of
a woman came beside him, and sometimes seemed to
him to touch him lightly on the shoulders. On each
occasion he merely caught a glimpse of her. When he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
left the army, and was on his way home, he came to
the village at Dervaig, in Mull, from the neighbourhood
of which the ferry across to Coll lay. He entered by
chance a house in the village, and his attention was
unexpectedly attracted by the sound of a weaver’s loom
at work in the house. On looking up he saw sitting
at the loom the identical woman whose figure had
for five years haunted him in Africa. He married her.</p>

<h3>COMING MISFORTUNE.</h3>

<p>A taïsher in Caolas, Tiree, was observed to have
great objections to going home to take his meals.
Being questioned on the subject, he said that at home
he saw a horrible-looking black woman, with her head
“as black as a pot,” and if he chanced to catch a
glimpse of her at meal-times, her hideous appearance
made him rise from his food. He said he did not
recognise the woman, and was unable to say who or
what she was. This was continued for three months,
when the place was visited with smallpox, and the
seer’s own sister took the disease very badly. Her
head became hideous, and literally “as black as a pot,”
and the people understood the meaning of the vision.</p>

<p>A celebrated seer in the same village, Donald Black
(<i>Domhnull Mac an dui</i>), was married for the fourth
time. In his day lucifer matches were unknown, and
when corn was kiln-dried a person had to sit up all
night to keep the fire alive. As Donald sat at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
work in a solitary hut—such as small kilns are still
kept in—the figure of his first wife appeared, and told
him to beware, for “the terror” (<i>an t-eagal</i>) was
coming, it was at the Horse-shoe (<i>crudh an eich</i>), a spot
on the public road leading to Caolis, about a mile and
a half distant, deriving its name from the plain likeness
of a horse-shoe indented in the rock. He, however,
was dozing over into sleep again when his second wife,
in more distressed tones, warned him the “terror” was
nearer hand—at the Gateway of the Fuel enclosure
(<i>Cachlaidh na Cuil Connaidh</i>). He neglected this
warning also, and was dozing again when his third wife
warned him the “terror” was at the upper village
(<i>Bail’ uachdrach</i>). He immediately went home, and
had hardly got into bed when a sound like the rushing
of a violent blast of wind passed, and the whole house
was shaken, so that the walls were like to fall. If
this was not “the terror” of which he had been so
strangely warned, Donald could give no other
explanation.</p>

<h3>EVENTS AT A DISTANCE.</h3>

<p>Some sixty years ago a seer in Ruaig, Tiree, the
neighbouring village to the preceding, was one day
employed in the harvest-field, tying sheaves after the
reapers, a work assigned to old people. One of his
sons was away in the Ross of Mull for a cargo of
peats. All of a sudden the old man cried out “Alas!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
alas! my loss!” (<i>och! och! mo chreach!</i>) His children
gathered round him in great anxiety as to the
cause of his distress. He told them to wait a minute
and in a short time said it was all right, his son was
safe. It turned out that at the very time of his exclamation,
the boat in which his son was on its way
from the Ross of Mull, was run into by another boat
at the Dutchman’s Cap (<i>Am Bac Mòr</i>), a peculiarly
shaped island on the way, and his son was thrown
overboard, but was rescued in time. The view of this
incident which his mystic gift gave the seer was the
cause of his exclamation.</p>

<h3>DEATH.</h3>

<p>Visionary delusions are so frequently to be traced to
a brooding, gloomy disposition, that it is no wonder
sorrowful sights were those usually seen by persons
having the Second Sight, or that death was an event
of which taïshers had particular cognisance. The
doctrine is, that the whole ceremony connected with
a funeral is gone through in rehearsal by spectres
which are the shades, phantoms, appearances, taïshs,
doubles, swarths, or whatever else we choose to call
them, of living men, not merely by the shade of the
person who is to die, but by the shades of all who are
to be concerned in the ceremony. The phantoms go
for the wood that is to make the coffin, the nails, the
dead clothes, and whatever else may be required on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
occasion; the sounds of the coffin being made are
heard, of presses being opened, of glasses rattling; and
the melancholy procession has been met in the dead of
night wending its way to the churchyard. These
weird sights and sounds have been seen and heard by
others as well as taïshers. The only difference is, that
he who has the Second Sight is more apt to see them.</p>

<h3>COFFIN.</h3>

<p>The shades that go for a coffin are called <i>tathaich
air ciste</i>, <i>i.e.</i> frequenters for a chest. They are heard
at night long after the joiner has ceased his day’s
labour. The workshop is closed, and the wright has
retired to rest, when the sound of a hammer, a shuffling
for nails, and the working of a plane, are heard as if
someone were at work. If anyone has the courage to
enter the workshop, nothing is to be seen, and no
answer is given though he speak.</p>

<p>Some fifty years ago there was a wright in Kinloch
Rannoch, in Perthshire, who complained of having the
Second Sight, and who, in emigrating to Australia,
assigned as his chief reason for leaving his native land,
the frequency with which he saw or heard people
coming beforehand for coffins. The tools of his trade,
plane, hammers, saw, etc., were heard by him at work
as distinctly as though he himself were working, and
the frequency of the omen preyed so much on his
mind that he left the country in the hope of relief.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
The shades were not those of the people whose death
was imminent, but those of their friends and acquaintances,
who afterwards proved actually to be the parties
who came for the coffin.</p>

<p>A few years ago a medical student, in the west of
Inverness-shire, sat up late on a summer night “grinding”
for his examination. A joiner’s workshop
adjoined the house in which he was. About two
o’clock in the morning he heard the sound of hammers,
plane, etc., as though some one were at work in the
shop. The sounds continued till about three. The
evening was calm. Next day when he told what he
had heard his friends laughed at him. Next night
again, however, the noises were resumed and continued
till he fell asleep. They were this night heard also by
the other inmates; and as they were repeated every
night for a week, every person in the house, including
the joiner himself, who was brought in for the purpose,
heard them. Shortly after a woman in the neighbourhood
died in childbed, and the joiner, in whose workshop
the noises were heard, made her coffin. The
mysterious hammering only discontinued when the
coffin was finished. The person who heard the
noises were neither taïshers nor sons of taïshers.</p>

<p>A Tiree man assured the writer that he and a
brother of his heard most distinctly (<i>ga farumach</i>) the
sound of a hammer all night till morning on a chest in
an empty room, near which they slept. A woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
next door died suddenly on the following day, and
it was on that chest another brother of his made her
coffin. The truthfulness of the persons who told this
can be assured, whatever be the explanation given of
the noise.</p>

<p>A very intelligent informant says that the only
thing of the kind he himself was personally witness
to occurred above fifty years ago, when he was a young
lad. An old woman of the neighbourhood lay on her
death-bed, and while the rest of the household, of
which he was a member, sat up, he was on account
of his youth packed off to bed. Through the night he
heard what he took to be the trampling of dogs on
a loft above his sleeping place, and this he heard so
distinctly that he asked his father next day what made
him put the dogs there. He also heard a plank sliding
down from the loft and striking on end in the passage
between the doors. The following night the old
woman died, and the lad himself was sent up to the
loft to bring down planks to make her coffin. A
plank slipped from his hands, and, falling on end in
the passage, made exactly the same noise as he had
before heard.</p>

<p>Some forty or fifty years ago the trampling of horses
and the rattling of a conveyance (<i>stararaich agus gliongarsaich</i>)
were heard after dark, coming to the farm-house
of Liaran in Rannoch. Every person in the
house thought a conveyance was really there. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
horses were distinctly heard turning round in the courtyard.
On looking out nothing was to be seen or heard.
In four or five days after, a hearse (a kind of conveyance
till then unknown in the country) came from
Appin of Menzies (<i>Apuinn na Meinearach</i>) with the
remains of a cousin of the family, who had been
suddenly killed by a kick from a horse.</p>

<p>As late as 1867 a coach was seen proceeding
silently through the streets of a village in Ayrshire to
the burying-ground, and was believed by the common
people to be that of a rich lady in the neighbourhood,
known as Brimstone Betty, who died shortly after, not
in the odour of sanctity.</p>

<h3>NOISE OF GLASSES TO BE USED AT FUNERALS.</h3>

<p>Some thirty years ago in Appin, Argyleshire, noises
were heard in a cupboard upstairs, above a room which
formed part of a neighbour’s house, as if some one were
fumbling among bottles. The noises were heard by
the inmates of both houses for several nights previous
to a somewhat sudden death occurring in the house
below. It turned out that bottles from that cupboard
were used at the funeral.</p>

<p>It was also a belief in Tiree that glasses, to be used
before long for refreshments at a funeral, were heard
rattling, as if being moved. Not many years ago there
was an instance of this in the village of Kilmoluag.
Skilful women professed to be able to tell by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
baking board and the “griddle” whether the bread of
that baking would be used at a funeral.</p>

<h3>FUNERAL PROCESSION.</h3>

<p>A boy in Rannoch was playing with his companions
in sight of the public road, when all of a sudden he
exclaimed, “Lord! will you not look at my grandmother’s
funeral?” (<i>Dhia! nach fhaic sibh tòrradh mo
sheanamhair.</i>) His grandmother was ill at the time, but
was not thought near her dissolution. In a few days after
her funeral took place, as the boy described it, with a
red-haired character of the neighbourhood dancing at
its head.</p>

<p>The following incident is told by a person whose
truthfulness is beyond question. He is a person of
talents and education, and a clergyman of the Church
of Scotland.</p>

<p>“A young lad, herd-boy in the village in the
Western Islands to which I belong, was one day with
me on the moors (<i>sliabh</i>), above the cultivated land,
when he said he saw two men carrying a coffin between
them from a wright’s workshop then in sight to the
door of a house, which he mentioned. He called my
attention to the vision, but I could see nothing of the
kind. He described the dress the two men had on,
particularly grey trousers, such as seafaring people
of the place then wore. In about ten days after an
event exactly corresponding occurred.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>A Tiree taïsher told how he had seen a funeral procession
leave a certain house, and persons whom he
named acting as coffin-bearers when leaving the house.
This was at Beltane, the first day of summer. Next
Christmas a death occurred in that house, and
one of those to whom the seer had told his vision,
took a good look at the funeral, to see if matters
would prove as the seer had said. They did so
exactly.</p>

<p>“On one occasion,” said a native of Harris, “I was out
fishing till twelve or one o’clock in the morning, with
several others, of whom one, a man about 35, was reputed
to have the Second Sight. As we were coming
home, I kept the middle of the road, thinking it was
the safest place, and that no evil could come near me
there. Suddenly the man, who had the Second Sight,
caught me by the shoulder and pulled me to the side
of the road. As he laid his hand on my shoulder I
saw a funeral procession—a coffin and men carrying it.
I was afterwards at that funeral myself, and at the
place where I met the taïsh, the men were in the same
order in which I had seen them.”</p>

<p>A young man going home at night, along the south
side of Loch Rannoch, was joined by a funeral procession.
One of the poles of the bier was thrust into
his hands, and he had to march in the procession above
a mile. He was on the lochside of the coffin, and had
great difficulty in keeping on the road. The other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
bearers of the ghostly coffin were laying the weight to
push him off the road.</p>

<p>A woman, near Loch Scavaig (<i>Scathabhaig</i>), in Skye,
saw a funeral procession, with the coffins, passing along
a hillside, where no road lay, and no one was ever
observed to pass. After the woman’s death, and two
years after her vision, a boat was lost in Loch Scavaig,
and the bodies of three persons lost in her were buried
near the shepherd’s house at the loch side. They
were afterwards raised and carried along in the direction
the woman had pointed out as that taken by her
vision.</p>

<p>One of these mystic processions was seen in Strathaird,
in the same neighbourhood, carrying something in
a grey plaid. A man was drowned in a river there,
and his body was not recovered for a week. It was
then carried in a grey plaid in the same direction the
spectral procession had taken.</p>

<p>A man in Skye met at night a funeral procession,
and some occult influence made him walk along with it
till he came to Portree churchyard. He then for the
first time asked whose funeral it was. He received for
answer, “Your own.”</p>

<p>A man living in the Braes of Portree went daily to
Portree, four miles away, to work. A neighbour, whose
house was a little further away, was engaged in the
same work, and was in the habit of calling him as he
passed in the morning. The two then walked together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
to the scene of their labour. One clear moonlight night
he was awakened by what he took to be his companion’s
call. He hastily threw on his clothes and
followed. Every now and then he heard a call before
him on the road telling him to make haste. He
followed, without thought, till he came to Portree
churchyard. It did not strike him till then that the
call was from no earthly voice.</p>

<h3>WRAITHS SEEN BEFORE DEATH.</h3>

<p>When a person was about to die, especially if his
death was to be by violence or drowning, his wraith or
phantom was seen by those who had the Second Sight,
or it might be by those who had no such gift.</p>

<p>In the island of Lismore, in the beginning of the
nineteenth century, the minister was said to have seen
the fetch of the man at whose funeral the custom was
introduced of having the refreshments (<i>cosdas</i>) after the
funeral. In former times it was the practice in the
Highlands to have the refreshments before starting, and
consequently the funeral party were sometimes far
advanced in drink before starting on their melancholy
journey. There are even stories of their having forgot
the coffin.</p>

<p>On the farm of Kirkapol, in Tiree, where the burying-place
of the east end of the island is, the figure of a
man in a dress not belonging to the island—light
trousers and blue jacket with white buttons—was seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
about forty years ago by several people in the evenings
going in the direction of the kirkyard. A celebrated
seer in the neighbouring village saw it, and said it was
not the taïsh of any man or any man’s son in Tiree.
Some time after a ship was wrecked in the east end of
Tiree, and one of the sailors, whose dress when his body
was found corresponded to that of the taïsh, was taken
and buried in Kirkapol. After that the apparition was
no more seen.</p>

<p>The body of a young man drowned in the same
neighbourhood, before being coffined, was laid first on
a rock and then on the green sward. A person who
came to the scene after the body was laid on the grass
asked if the body had been laid on the rock mentioned.
He was told it had, and was asked why he enquired.
He said his uncle had told him that his grandfather,
who was a taïsher, had said a dead body would yet be
laid on that rock. This shows that the fulfilment of
the seer’s vision does not necessarily take place soon
after, or even within a number of years.</p>

<p>The taïsher in Caolas, Tiree, already mentioned as
having seen the fetch of his sister in the smallpox, on
a New-Year night accompanied his brother-in-law, who
had spent the evening with him (and from whom the
story has been got), a piece of the way home. When
his brother-in-law urged him to return, as he had come
far enough, he asked to be allowed, as this was the last
New Year he would be with his friends. He was asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
what made him think so gloomily of the future. He
said the matter was to be so, and there was no chance
of its being otherwise, for he had seen his own
phantom three or four times. In March following
the man was drowned.</p>

<p>A Tiree taïsher was going out to Tobermory, and
taking his passage along with him was a neighbour
going to consult the doctor. There was no medical
officer in those days resident in Tiree. The seer said
to one of the boatmen, he wished he had not the sight
he had, for he saw his fellow-passenger with the dead
clothes up to his eyes. “You may,” he said, “take off
my ear if the man’s death is not near hand.” The
event proved the correctness of his vision, and the
right to take off his ear did not arise.</p>

<h3>DROWNING.</h3>

<p>It is a common story that a taïsher saw the figure of
an acquaintance passing with dripping clothes and
water in its shoes (<i>aodach fliuch agus bogan na bhròig</i>).
Soon after word was received of the drowning of the
person, whose resemblance it was, at the time the
figure was seen.</p>

<p>The seeing of spectres about boats in which people
are to be drowned, is also common. When the superstition
was in full force, a sure way of making a boat
useless was to say that voices had been heard about it
when it was drawn upon the beach, or that figures had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
been seen, which disappeared mysteriously, “whether
the earth swallowed them, or the sky lifted them.”
After that no one having a regard for his own life
would put his foot in that boat.</p>

<p>A person from Tiree went for wood to Loch Creran,
and at Tobermory forgot the parcel in which he had a
change of clothes. One day he got wet, soaked
through to the skin, and had to sit all evening in his
wet clothes. On his return home to Tiree a woman,
who was reputed to have the gift of second sight, asked
him if, on a certain day of the week (mentioning the
one on which this accident occurred), he had got himself
wetted, that she had seen him, and thought he had
been drowned. The man himself tells the story, and
says he cannot conceive of any ordinary channel of
information by which the woman could have become
aware of his condition.</p>

<p>A man named Conn was drowned at Sorisdal, in
Coll. A seer, who had been at daily work with him,
had long seen his boots full of water (<i>bogan uisge</i>),
when there was no water in them in reality; and for
twelve months after the event, was haunted wherever
he went by the vision of Conn’s drowning.</p>

<p>A seer in Skye saw, when in reality there was no
such object, a woman sitting in the stern of a boat,
which afterwards drowned people in Portree Bay.</p>

<p>A fishing boat or skiff belonging to the people of
Gortendonald, in the west end of Tiree, was sold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
because “things” were said to have been seen about it,
till no one belonging to the village would venture to
sea in it. It was bought by some persons in Scarinish,
in the east end of the island, who professed not to
believe in <i>taibhsearachd</i>, or second sight. They gave
the loan of it to people in Vaul, on the north side of
the island. Here sights began again to be seen about
it, and it was even said that at a time when it was
hauled up on dry land, six men were seen rowing in it
and one steering. At last no one at all would venture
to sea in the boat, and it was sent back to Scarinish.
So strong was the feeling that the Vaul men would not
venture with it through the Black Water (<i>am Bun
dubh</i>), as the sound between Coll and Tiree is called,
but drew it across the land to Gott Loch, whence the
Scarinish people took it home. After this, its odour in
the east end of Tiree became so bad that it was sold
again to villagers in the west end, at some distance
from the place it originally came from. Here it
terminated its career in Tiree by drowning six men.</p>

<p>Sights were similarly seen about a boat in Iona, and
it had to be sold. It went to Islay, and the visions
were believed to have received their fulfilment from the
boat being employed to convey dead bodies from a
ship wrecked on the Rhinns of Islay (<i>an Roinn Ileach</i>,
lit. the sharp edge of Islay).</p>

<p>Not many years ago, a man told about a boat on
the south side of Tiree, that he had heard voices about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
it, like those of people talking, but on going near
found no person there. He did not know, he said,
whether the air had lifted the people whom he thought
were there, or the earth had swallowed them, but he
had heard voices, and no person was there. The boat
became worthless, it would drown some one some day,
and no one would go out to fish in it. The owner,
therefore, summoned the seer before the Sheriff and got
him fined.</p>

<h3>HORSES AND DOGS.</h3>

<p>These animals were deemed to have the gift of
seeing spectres in a larger measure than the best seers.
They are observed to be frightened, or to have their
fury raised, without any visible or intelligible cause;
they show signs of terror and distress when human
eyes can see no cause, and it is part of the Celtic belief
in the second sight that this excitement is caused by
seeing the taïsh, or shades of the living, in those circumstances,
and engaged in those services in which the
persons, whose similitude they are, will afterwards be.
Dogs bark at night, and when this occurs on clear
moonlight nights, they are said in English to “bay the
moon.” The Celtic belief does not deny that they
often bark at the moon, but it asserts further their
clamour arises, as the event afterwards proves, from
their seeing the forms of that world, in which fetches
and doubles move, the omens of an impending death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Horses are better spectre-seers than even dogs. At
places where a violent or sudden death is to occur, they
take fright, and no effort of the rider can get them to
pass the spot, till at last he has to dismount and lead
them past. This is caused by their seeing the “fetch” of
the subsequent event, but ordinary people pass it over
merely as an “unaccountable fright.”</p>

<p>“I have heard,” said a Skyeman, “scores of times
the dogs howling before a funeral was to take place in
Kilmuir churchyard. It was because they saw the
wraiths of the living” (<i>tàslaich nan daoine beò</i>). It is a
universal Highland belief that certain dogs cry at night
when any one in the house is to die.</p>

<p>In Lorn, a woman, going with leather to a neighbouring
shoemaker, had on her way to cross a wooden
bridge thrown over a mountain stream. She was
accompanied by a young child, whom she left, while
she herself crossed the bridge to leave the parcel of
leather on the other side. As she was crossing a
second time, leading the child, the stream came down
in flood, as mountain streams do, and carried away the
bridge. The woman and child were drowned, and
their bodies were found further down the stream, at a
place where, for fourteen days previously, a grey tailless
bitch (<i>galla chutach ghlas</i>), belonging to a neighbour,
used to go and howl piteously.</p>

<p>The fierce growling of a dog at night, when nothing
is known to be in the house to excite its fury, is also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
supposed to arise from its seeing spirits, or the spectres,
it is not known which, of the living or of the dead.
Stories of this class usually run in the same groove.
A shepherd or servant-man has a very good dog, which
is in the habit of sleeping in the same room with
himself. One night it suddenly gets up growling, and
is heard making its way to the other end of the room.
It returns howling faintly, springs into bed, and, lying
with its forepaws resting on its master, snarls fiercely
at something invisible. The occupant of the bed, not
seeing anything to account for the dog’s fury, puts his
head below the bedclothes and quakes with fear till
daylight.</p>

<p>A horse in Vaul, Tiree, ordinarily a quiet beast
used, when carting, to be most unaccountably startled
especially when passing a certain boat, drawn up on
the beach. This same boat has been mentioned
already as having, in consequence of being spectre-haunted,
been sold by people in the west end of Tiree
to some villagers in the east end, who gave the loan of
it to Vaul people. Lights began also to be seen about
it, and it was ultimately sent back to the lenders, who
again sold it to people in the west end. Here a
melancholy loss of life occurred in it. A gale off the
land suddenly sprang up, when the boat, with its six of
a crew, was within a few hundred yards of the shore.
The men were seen rowing hard to bring the boat to
land, but they had at last to give up the attempt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Some days after, the boat came ashore in Coll, with
only one of the crew in it. He was reclining on one of
the thwarts dead. It was the horse and cart mentioned
that took home his body. After that day the
horse was never known to be unaccountably startled or
frightened. Its former fits entirely forsook it.</p>

<h3>CRYING HEARD BEFORE DEATH.</h3>

<p>A wailing or unusual cry heard at night, where no
one is known to be, or can be, is an indication that at
that place some one will break into lamentation for the
death of a friend, of which he will there first receive
intimation, or will have otherwise cause to cry. The
voice heard is not that of the “fetch” of the man, who
is to be killed or drowned, but that of some mourner—a
wife, or sister, or near relation. In these cries before
a sudden death, the voices of women are the most
frequently recognised.</p>

<p>A cry or scream, indicative of death, and believed to
be uttered by a wraith, was called <i>tàsg</i>, and <i>éigheach
tàisg</i> or <i>éigheach tàsg</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the cry of a wraith.</p>

<p>In the case of a man accidentally drowned on Trabay
Beach in Tiree, a cry described as “a healthy cry”
(<i>glaodh fallain</i>) was heard at night in the west end of
the island several days previous to the disaster, and
four miles from the scene of the accident, at the spot
where the man’s brother first received the melancholy
intelligence. The cry consisted of “òh” said thrice, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
each time at the full length of a man’s breath (<i>fad
analach</i>).</p>

<p>At the old quay in Port Appin, Argyleshire, the
wailing of a woman was heard at night. Some days
after, the mother of a young man who had been
accidentally killed in Glasgow, there met the remains,
which came by steamer, and she broke into loud
lamentation.</p>

<p>At the Big Bridge (<i>an Drochaid Mhor</i>) above Portree
Manse, on the road to Braes, in the Isle of Skye,
strange sounds are heard by people passing there at
night, such as the moaning of a dying person, sounds
of throttling, etc. Mysterious objects, dogs, and indistinct
moving objects are also seen at the haunted spot.
These are supposed to denote that a murder will some
time be committed here.</p>

<p>Weeping and crying were heard at midnight near
the mill-dam in Tiree, on a dark and rainy night, by a
young man going for a midwife for his brother’s wife.
He heard the same sounds on his return. The woman
died in that childbed, and it was observed that at the
very spot where the young man said he heard the
sounds of lamentation, her two sisters first met after
her death, and burst into tears and outcries. The
person to whom this incident occurred is now past
forty years of age, is intelligent, and to be relied on as
a person who would not tell a lie. There can be no
doubt he heard the lamentation, whatever may have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
been the cause of his impression. Strange noises, of
which the natural cause is not known, are readily
associated with the first incident that offers any
explanation.</p>

<p>In the island of Mull, lamentation (<i>tuireadh</i>) was
recollected to have been heard where a young man was
accidentally killed ten years after.</p>

<p>Thirty years ago horrible screaming and shouting
(<i>sgiamhail oillteil agus glaodhaich</i>) were heard about
eight o’clock on a summer evening across Loch Corry
in Kingairloch. In a line with the shouting lay a
ship at anchor, and the burying-ground on the other
side of the loch. The cry was like that of a goat or
buck being killed, a bleating which bears a horrible
resemblance to the human voice. Next night the
master of the ship was drowned, no one knew how.
The man on the watch said that when sitting in the
stern of the ship he saw the skipper go below, and
then a clanking as if the chain were being paid out.
He heard and saw nothing further. The night was
fine.</p>

<p>In July, 1870, a ship struck on a sunken rock in
the passages between the Skerryvore lighthouse and
Tiree, and sprang a leak. The shore was made for at
once, but when within 150 yards of it the ship sank.
The crew betook themselves to the rigging, and were
ultimately rescued; but the skipper, in trying to swim
ashore, was caught by the current that sweeps round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Kennavara Hill, and drowned. The crying heard in
Kennavara Hill four years previous was deemed to
have portended this event.</p>

<p>Crying was heard several times on the reefs to the
east end of Coll, and to the best of the hearer’s belief,
it was in English. In the same year (1870), a boat or
skiff with two East Coast fishermen, following their
calling in that neighbourhood, went amissing, and was
never heard of. Many were of opinion it must have
been lost on the reefs, where the cries had long
previously been heard.</p>

<h3>LIGHTS.</h3>

<p>It was deemed a good sign when lights were seen
previous to a person’s death. The <i>dreag</i> was a light
seen in the sky, leaving a tail (<i>dreallsach</i>) behind it,
and, according to some, stopping above the house where
the death was to occur; according to others, proceeding
from above the house to the churchyard, along
the line the funeral was to take. The <i>dreag</i> was seen
only when a person of consequence was near his dissolution.
Hence an irreverent tailor in East-side,
Skye, said he wished the sky was full of dreags.</p>

<p>It was also a belief that the death-light went along
the road a funeral was to take.</p>

<p>An old man in Druim-a-chaoin, in Lower Rannoch,
being sceptical on this point, was one night called to
the door to believe his own eyes. His house overlooked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the public road, and stepping boldly down he
stood in the middle of the road awaiting the approach
of the death-light. When it reached him, it also stood,
right before him. The old man gazed fixedly at the
unearthly light, and at last an indistinct and shadowy
form became visible in the middle of it. The form
slowly placed the palms of its two hands together, and
extended them towards him. With a startling suddenness
it said “Whish!” and passed over his head.
That old man never afterwards said a word against
death-lights.</p>

<p>In another instance of the death-light proceeding
along the highway in the same district, a hare-brained
young man went to meet it, and stood waiting it
behind his dirk, which he stuck in the middle of the
road. When the light came to the dirk it stopped, and
the young man gazing at it, at last saw a child’s face
in its feeble glare. He then stooped down and drew
his dirk from the ground. As he did so the light
passed over his head.</p>

<p>Lights were also seen where a violent or accidental
death was to occur, and might be seen by the person
whose death they fore-tokened. Thus, at Brae-Glen
(<i>Bràighe Ghlinne</i>) in Glen-Iuchar, where a river falls
into Loch Sgamadail, in Lorn, lights were seen two
years previous to the drowning of a man of the name
of Maclachlan, in the stream when drunk. Maclachlan
had seen these lights himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>Lights, to which these mysterious meanings are
attached, are generally mere <i>ignes fatui</i>. They have of
late years become prevalent in the Hebrides, and
various explanations are given of them. In Tiree they
are called “Fairy light” (<i>Teine sìth</i>), and are said to be
produced by a bird. In Skye and the northern islands
they are called the “Uist light” (<i>Solus Uithist</i>), and the
following extraordinary account is given of their origin:</p>

<p>A young girl one Sunday night insisted, in spite of
her mother’s remonstrances, on starting with a hook
and creel to gather plants in the field for some species
of dye before the Sabbath was expired. Finding her
counsels of no avail, the mother in a rage told her to go
then and never return: the young girl never returned,
but her hook and creel were found in the fields, and
marks of fighting at the spot. When encountered, the
light jumps three times, and its appearance is that of
human ribs with a light inside of them. It is only
an odd number that can see this light. Two will not
see it, but three can. Like other supernatural appearances
it could only speak when spoken to. A young
lad once had the courage to speak to it. The light
answered that it was the young girl whom the above
fate befell: that she had done wrong in disobeying
her mother, and breaking the Sabbath day; that it
was her mother’s prayer that was the cause of her
unrest; and that she was now doomed to wander about
in the shape of this light till the end of the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<h3>SPIRITS SEEN BEFORE DEATH.</h3>

<p>Shortly before death greenish bright lights were
seen moving from one place to another, when no other
light was in the room. These were said to be spirits
awaiting the soul of the dying person. When the
body lay stretched out, previous to being coffined,
these lights were seen hovering near, and perhaps seven
or eight butterflies (<i>dealan-dé</i>) fluttered through the
room. They moved about the chest, in which were
the bannocks to be used at the funeral, or the
winding-sheet (<i>blà-lìn</i>), and about the cupboard in
which the glasses were. The belief in these appearances
was not commonly entertained.</p>

<p>A belief in the occurrence of something supernatural
at the moment of death seems to have been not
altogether uncommon. On an occasion already
mentioned of a sudden death at Port Appin, Argyleshire,
which was preceded by the noise of bottles
rattling, a girl opened the door of a side room at the
moment of the sick man’s dissolution. She returned
in a state bordering on hysteria, cursing and swearing,
that she would not take the world and go in. She
said every article in the room seemed to meet her at
the door.</p>

<h3>RETURN OF THE DEAD.</h3>

<p>The plant <i>mòthan</i> (<i>sagina procumbens</i>), or Trailing
Pearlwort, was placed by old women in Tiree above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the door, on the lintel (<i>san àrd-dorus</i>), to prevent
the spirits of the dead, when they revisited their former
haunts, from entering the house, and it was customary
in many places to place a drink of water beside the
corpse previous to the funeral, in case the dead should
return.</p>

<p>There is a sept of Macdonalds called MacCannel, of
whom it is said in Tiree, that when one dies and the
body is laid out to be waked, all the dead of the race
enter the room, go round the body, upon which each
lays his hand, and then in solemn procession march
out again. This is the case at every death of one
of the sept, but only those who have the second sight
can see the shades. A man married to one of the
MacCannels, whose father had been long dead, enraged
her beyond measure, on the occasion of the death of
one of the sept, by asking her why she had not gone to
Ballevullen (where the death had occurred), last night
to see her father.</p>

<p>The spirits of the dead came back to reveal secrets
and give good advice. Those who hid iron during
their lifetime, and died without telling where, could not
rest till they had told their secret. Notoriously bad
men, misers, oppressors of the poor, and all whose
affections were set too much on the things of this
world, were believed after death to wander about their
former haunts. They seek to be where they left their
treasure. They do not speak till they are spoken to,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
and it requires great courage in a living person to
address the spirits of the dead. The last buried had
to watch the churchyard till the next funeral; and if
the strings of the winding-sheet were not untied, it was
also a belief that the spirit could not rest.</p>

<p>It is very imprudent to enter into a compact with
another, that whoever dies first will come back to tell
his fate to the survivor. The agreement is unholy,
and will entail sorrow, whether the dead man’s position
is in weal or woe.</p>

<p>Two herdsmen at the summer pastures for the
cattle (<i>bothan àiridh</i>) in “the wilds of far Kintail”
entered into a compact of this kind. One of them
died, and a substitute came in his place. The newcomer
observed that his companion was anxious not
to be alone for any time, however short, but one day
he had to go to the strath for yeast (<i>deasgainn</i>), the two
being engaged in brewing spirits, and did not return
till far on in the night. The survivor of the two who
had made the paction, being thus left alone, when night
came on took to mending his shoes and singing at his
work to keep his courage up. His thoughts constantly
reverted to his dead companion, and the bargain made
with him, and the more he thought the more uneasy
he became. At midnight a scraping noise began on
the top of the house, as if some one were trying to
make an entrance. The scraping became louder and
louder, and the shoemaker, in the agony of terror, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
pretending to think the noise was made by his comrade
who had gone to the strath, called out, “I know
it is you trying to frighten me” (<i>cuir eagal orm</i>). As
soon as he spoke, a man, whom he recognised as his
dead companion, entered the hut, wrapped in the grave
clothes, but after saying it was a good thing for him
where he (the dead man) had gone, went away and
left him unharmed.</p>

<p>In another case of a similar agreement between two
youths in the same district, the survivor forgot all
about the paction, till one night he was met on the
public road by the figure of his departed friend, which
told him to meet it alone at a certain place (which it
named) at a certain hour, otherwise it would be worse
for himself. The man, terrified beyond measure, consulted
the parish minister as to what he ought to do,
but the minister merely advised him to pray that no
evil would come of his rash and unguarded compact.
He consulted an old man, who told him to go to the place
appointed and take a ball of iron in his hand, and hold
it out to the ghost when shaking hands. The man
went, the ghost crushed the ball of iron and the man
escaped, otherwise the spirit, which could only have
come from a bad place, would have crushed his hand
into atoms.</p>

<p>A woman in Flodigarry, in Skye, whose husband
had been killed by witchcraft (<i>buidseachd</i>), saw him
after his death sitting by the fireside. On being spoken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
to, the ghost asked, why they had not shaved him
before putting his body in a coffin?<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<h3>BONES OF THE DEAD AND PLACE OF BURIAL.</h3>

<p>It was part of the lesson impressed on the young
Highlander, to treat that which belonged to the dead
with reverence. The unnecessary or contemptuous
disturbing of graves, bones, or other relics of humanity
was reprobated, and sometimes warmly resented. This
praiseworthy feeling towards the dead was strengthened
by the pride of race and ancestry, which formed so
prominent a feature of the Highland character, and by
sundry tales of wide circulation.</p>

<p>The story has been already told of the tailor who
irreverently gave a kick to a skull, and was ever after
haunted by the man to whom it had belonged. It is
told of one who disturbed a grave at night, that, on
his taking up a skull in his hand, a feeble voice, that
of the disturbed spirit, said, “That’s mine.” He dropped
that skull and took up another, when a like voice said,
“That’s mine.” The man cried out, “Had you two
skulls?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>Tradition says the island of Islay derives its name
from Ile, a Scandinavian princess, who went to bathe
in a loch there, and sticking in the soft mud, was
drowned. The head and footstones of her grave are
some distance from each other, and of three persons,
who successively attempted to open the grave to see
what the bones were like, each died mad! Very likely
this was the fate awaiting them at any rate. Their
action in opening a grave, to satisfy an idle curiosity,
was in keeping with a morbid character, and they only
died as they lived.</p>

<p>Stones from a disused burying-ground, called “The
Burial-place of the Big Women,” on the farm of Heynish,
in Tiree, were used for building one of the farm
out-houses. In this house, a servant man from Mull
was sent to sleep. Through the night he was disturbed
by his dog jumping into bed, between him and the
wall, and with its fore feet resting upon his body,
snarling fiercely at something he could not see. He
heard feeble voices through the house, saying, “This is
the stone that was at my head.” Nothing more came
of this visit of the spirits, than that the Mull man (who
was likely the victim of a hoax) positively refused to
sleep in that house again.</p>

<p>The manner in which shades haunt the places where
their bodies are, is very clearly shown in the following
tale.</p>

<p>The body of a woman was cast ashore by the sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
on the North Beach, called the Beach of Fell (<i>Tràigh
Feall</i>), in the island of Coll, and was buried in the
neighbouring sandbanks. After this, the semblance of
a woman was seen in the evenings on the beach, close
to the tide. Maclean, the then tenant of Caolas, a farm
near hand, ridiculed the belief. One evening, however,
when going home across the North Beach, at the
White Stream (<i>Sruth Bàn</i>), he thought of the numerous
stories he had heard of the apparition, and, looking
seaward, saw a woman sitting by the tide, rocking
herself (<i>ga turruman fhein</i>), and apparently in the
utmost distress. He went where she was, and asked
her what she was doing? “Hand of cleverness” (<i>làmh
thapaidh</i>), she answered, “I have been long here; I
try to go home, but I cannot. I was a poor woman
belonging to Uist; I was lost on a rock; my body
came ashore here, and I try to go home, but cannot;
my body keeps me.” Maclean asked what reward she
would give, if he took her body home. She promised
to be with him in every quarrel or fight, in which he
might be involved. This offer he declined, saying his
own hand was strong enough to extricate him in any
difficulty of that kind. She then offered him the gift
of knowing the thief, if anything should be stolen in
Coll. This gift he accepted, and the stones that
marked the grave being told him, he sent for the
woman’s brothers, the body was taken home, and the
spectre was no more seen on the North Beach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<h3>SPIRITS APPEARING IN DREAMS.</h3>

<p>A deceased sister’s ghost appeared to a woman in a
dream, and told her, their brother had been buried the
day before in Ireland. She also told the signs, by
which next day the truth of the dream was to be
proved. The words of the ghost form in Gaelic a
singularly beautiful and plaintive song. Each line is
repeated twice in singing, first with one and then another
of those meaningless choruses to be found in Gaelic
melody, and suiting well with the genius of the language.</p>

<h3>TO GET RID OF THE SECOND SIGHT.</h3>

<p>It was a belief in the island of Coll that a person
afflicted with the second sight might get rid of his
unhappy gift, and, as it were, bind it away (<i>nasg</i>) from
himself, by giving alms (<i>déirc</i>) and praying the gift may
depart. A seer living near Arinagour in that island
had two sons in the army, then engaged in foreign
wars, and in his visions saw what was happening to
them. The visions preyed so much on his mind that,
to rid himself of them, he gave half-a-crown to an old
woman, and prayed his second sight might be taken
away. After this he saw nothing of his sons, and,
anxious to know their fate, he went to Tiree for a
celebrated taïsher, and brought him to Coll with him.
He placed him beside the fire, which was on the middle
of the floor. It was held by the best seers that visions
are best seen through the fire (<i>roi’ n teine</i>). Before long
the Tiree seer began to sweat, and the other, who knew
that this was caused by a painful vision, begged him to
tell what he saw, and hide nothing. He told that both
the sons were killed—the one by a bullet through the
head, the other shot through the heart and through the
neck. Soon after a letter came to the Laird of Coll
corroborating the seer’s vision.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="smaller">HOBGOBLINS.</span></h2>

<p>The term <i>Bòchdan</i> (pron. Baucan) is a general name
for terrifying objects seen at night, and taken to be
supernatural, bugbears, ghosts, apparitions, goblins, etc.,
in all their variety. The word conveys as much the
idea of fright in the observer as of anything hurtful or
violent in the object itself. It is derived from <i>bòchd</i>, to
come in a swelling and resistless flood, not an unapt
description of the manner in which fear takes possession
of its victims. Any object, indistinctly seen, may prove
a hobgoblin of this kind. It may be merely a neighbour
playing pranks by going about in a white sheet,
a stray dog, a bush waving and sighing in the night
wind, or even a peat-stack looming large in the imperfect
light. There is a story of a man on Loch
Rannoch-side who fought a bush, in mistake for a
ghost, in a hollow, which had an evil name for being
haunted. The conflict continued till dawn, when he
was found exhausted, scratched, and bleeding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes the Baucan, or terrifying object, causes
fright by its mere appearance, sometimes by the noises
it makes, and sometimes by its silence. In appearance
it is commonly a man or woman moving silently past,
and not speaking till spoken to, if even then; but it
has also been encountered as a black dog, that accompanies
the traveller part of his way, as a headless body
(a particularly dangerous form of ghost), as a he-goat,
or simply a dark moving object. At other times it is
terrific from having a chain clanking after it, from its
whistling with unearthly loudness, by horrible and
blood-freezing cries and sounds of throttling, and
sometimes it makes its presence known only by faint
and hardly audible sounds. In fact, the number and
variety of things by which superstitious terror may be
awakened at night are countless.</p>

<p>In most cases the Baucan is deemed the precursor of
a sudden or violent death to occur at the place where
it is seen or heard. It is remembered after the event
that an unaccountable light was seen there at night, or
a horse had become uneasy and could not be induced
by its rider to pass, or something extraordinary had
been observed, which the popular imagination connects
with the subsequent event. At other times the Baucan
is the spirit of the dead revisiting the earth, that it
may be spoken to, and unburden itself of some secret
that disturbs its rest. Sometimes it is an evil spirit on
some message of darkness and sometimes merely a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
sound or indistinct object by which the wayfarer is
frightened, but of which he is unable to give any lucid
description. Fright is destructive of curiosity, and a
person ready to faint with terror cannot be expected to
be critical in his observations, nor afterwards coherent
in his statements. Besides, vagueness or indistinctness
as to the cause—an element to which the obscurity of
night lends a ready aid—tends to render fear more
frantic. If the observer had a distinct view of the
object of his alarm, and knew exactly what it was,
even though it were a spirit of darkness, his terror
would be less. <i>Omne ignotum pro magnifico</i> is an
axiom that holds especially true in such cases, and it is
ignorance of its own cause that gives terror its wildest
forms. A ghost or apparition seen in the day time, if
that were possible, would not be at all so dreadful.</p>

<p>It may be said, that every Highland village has near
it a locality where a ghost or <i>baucan</i> is, or was, to be
seen. A favourite haunt for these unearthly visitants is
by the fords of rivers (<i>beul àth na h-aimhne</i>), where
generally bridges have been built in modern times, near
churchyards, on dark moors, and in hollows, or rather
at the top of the ascent from hollows, traversed by the
public road. Not unfrequently there is a projecting
rock (<i>sròin creige</i>) near the spot, and this may have its
own share in producing that sense of loneliness and
awe, which makes the belated peasant prone to convert
stray animals and unusual appearances into ghosts and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
spirits. It is a noticeable feature in ghost stories, that
it is principally to those travelling alone, and not
accustomed to walk the night, that ghosts are visible.
They have been seen in houses, and even in towns, but
ordinarily they affect lonely places, where naturally men
are more apt to be timorous.</p>

<p>The “Black Shore” (<i>du-chladach</i>) as it is called, <i>i.e.</i>
the shore below the line or roll of seaweed thrown up
by the tide (<i>ròlag ròid</i>), is, according to Highland
belief, an asylum from all kinds of supernatural beings
that haunt the night, fairies, ghosts, or evil spirits. No
being “at all, at all” of the kind (<i>seòrsa sam bith, sam
bith</i>) can go below the tide mark. The confidence of
the timorous in this place of refuge is confirmed by the
assurance that they are not exposed to a similar danger
from the sea. It is a saying, “Evil comes not from the
sea” (<i>Cha d’thig olc sam bith o’n fhairge</i>).</p>

<p>Ghosts and evil spirits cannot cross a running stream,
a belief which had its origin before the days of bridges.
The shock given to the nerves by the cold water, when
it was of any depth, served to dispel the optical delusion
caused by unfounded terror.</p>

<p>When about to encounter a Baucan the dirk should
be partly drawn from its sheath, otherwise it will prove
impossible during the encounter to draw the weapon.
In the event of the evil spirit asking its name it
should not be called by its proper name, “a dirk”
(<i>biodag</i>), but “my father’s sister” (<i>piuthar m’athar</i>),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
“my grandmother’s sister” (<i>piuthar mo sheanamhair</i>)
or by some similar title. This prevents enchantments
being laid upon it to render it useless. The effect of
these is, that instead of giving the ghost its <i>quietus</i>, the
weapon merely makes a tinkling noise (<i>gliong</i>) against
it. Evil spirits cannot bear the touch of cold steel.
Iron, or preferably steel, in any form is a protection,
though it is not obvious how or why, against the
fairies,—an iron ring on the point of a staff is as good
as a sword, but evil spirits are subdued by it only when
made into a lethal weapon.</p>

<p>In the struggle the ghost is in the hands of its
opponent, soft as a bag of wool or impalpable as air.
At every tussle, therefore, the unfortunate man is
thrown down and injured.</p>

<p>In the presence of an evil spirit, a dog defends its
master, or crouches in terror about his feet, but a bitch
jumps at his throat, and if it can will tear him. It is,
however, rendered harmless, by taking blood from its
ear, or tying a collar (<i>conghal</i> i.e. <i>ceangal</i>), usually its
master’s garter, about its neck. Similarly an entire
horse was said to defend its master, but a mare attacked
him. It was also a belief, that an entire horse could
not be injured by witches or evil spirits.</p>

<p>The best protection is a circle drawn round one’s self
on the ground with the point of a sapling or dirk,
saying “The Cross of Christ be upon us” (<i>Crois
Chriosd oirnn!</i>) All the spirits that infest the night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
may dash in fury against this circle, but they can no
more pass it, than the most threatening waves of the
sea the rocks that form their appointed bounds. As
already suggested, this circle is the superstitious representative
of a person’s own integrity, within which he is
safe from the attacks and wiles of the devil. It is
known also in Ireland, as the following story told in
Arisaig, Inverness-shire, by an Irish packman, shows.</p>

<p>A priest’s brother having died, a young man, who
had been a bosom friend of his, expressed an ardent
wish some weeks after to see him again. That same
evening he was met by the shade of his dead companion,
and the two had a long talk together. They
spoke of the pleasure, they had in each other’s society,
and the dead man got the other to promise to meet
him at the same spot the following evening. It added,
“To make you sure it is indeed I, you will tell my
brother the priest of such and such an occurrence
[describing it], which nobody knows but he and I.” On
his way home, the young man called upon the priest,
and told what he had seen. “It is not my brother’s
ghost at all,” said the priest, “but the devil, who is trying
to decoy you into his power; I will go with you to-morrow
night to meet him.” The two went together to
the place of appointment, the priest taking with him a
dirk, with which he traced a circle round them, and an
iron hoop, inside of which also they stood. A figure in
face and form like the priest’s brother, “most like, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
not the same,” came, but on finding itself outwitted, and
a Bible being opened before it, went away in a flame of
fire.</p>

<h3>THE <i>Bodach</i>, OR CARLE.</h3>

<p>The <i>bodach</i> (lit. a carle, an old man) is perhaps the
commonest form of Baucan, so common that in some
districts, <i>e.g.</i> the Lord Reay country (<i>Dùthaich Mhic Aoi</i>),
as the seven parishes nearest to Cape Wrath are called,
they have no other name for apparitions or terrifying
objects seen at night. It is the figure of a man, who
is no “living wight,” seen at night, and as may readily
be imagined, this kind of apparition is frequently seen
when children are obstreperous, querulous, or crying
without cause, as their manner is. The Beckoning Old
Man (<i>Bodach an Sméididh</i>) appears about the corners
of houses, making signs with his hand for people to
come to him. The <i>Corra-lòigein</i>, whatever his name
may mean, stands in places which it is desirable to
keep children from wandering to after dark, and will
ill-treat any of whom it gets a hold. The principal of
these <i>Lemures</i> is “The Son of Platter-pool,” whose full
title is, “The Son of Platter-pool from grey spike, silken
spike, great caterpillar.”<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> This, as his name indicates,
is really a frightful bugbear; he looks in at windows,
flattens his face against the panes, sharpens his teeth
with much noise, and takes away children in a twinkling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
unless they keep quiet. Neither he, however, nor
any of his brother bugbears, enter a house unless
called in. The threat of doing so is generally quite
sufficient to silence the most ill-grained child.</p>

<h3>FUATH.</h3>

<p>This word means literally aversion, hatred, but in
Ross-shire is a common word to denote an apparition,
ghost, spectre. In this latter sense, it is rare in Argyleshire.
In the poem of the <i>Muireartach</i> or <i>Muileartach</i>,
which may be translated, “Western Sea,” foster-mother
of Manus, King of Lochlin, describing her attack upon
Fin MacCoul and his men, it is said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The name of the daring spectre (fuath)</div>
<div class="verse">Was the bold, red, white-maned Westlin Sea;</div>
<div class="verse">Her face was dusky, of the hue of coal,</div>
<div class="verse">The teeth of her jaws crooked red;</div>
<div class="verse">In her head there glared a single eye,</div>
<div class="verse">That swifter moved than bait-pursuing mackerel;</div>
<div class="verse">And on her head there bristled dark-grey hair,</div>
<div class="verse">Like brushwood covered with hoar-frost.”<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The attributes of the <i>Fuath</i> are different in different
tales, and Mr. Campbell (<i>Tales of the West Highlands</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
ii. 191) has fallen into the error of conjoining attributes
ascribed in several stories, and representing the <i>Fuath</i>
as a water spirit, having web-feet, tail, mane, etc. The
name of a desolate moor near Ullapool, in Ross-shire,
“The Flat-stoned Declivity of Fuaths” (<i>Leathad
leacanta nam Fuath</i>), is alone convincing it was not
deemed particularly a water spirit.</p>

<p>The following tales will illustrate the character of
Highland hobgoblins and such-like objects of terror
better than a lengthened disquisition.</p>

<h3>CACHLAIDH NA FEUSAIG, ISLAY.</h3>

<p>At the bottom of a dell, or hollow, through which
the public road lies, in the island of Islay, there was a
gate across the road, bearing the above name, which
means “The Beard gateway.” At this place things
unearthly were encountered after dark. One night a
man saw an indistinct object coming towards him. He
could give no account of it, but that its mouth was
wide open, as if to devour him, and that from the width
of its gape he could see its lungs (<i>sgamhan</i>) down its
throat. He was accompanied, fortunately, by a large
Newfoundland dog, which rushed between his legs at
the “thing,” and a terrific fight ensued. He ran away
home, leaving them at it. In the morning the dog
came without any hair on its body, and shortly after
its return expired.</p>

<p>About the middle of February, a party was coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
home from the market held on the Level Ridge (<i>Imire
Còmhnard</i>) at Ballygrant (Ugly Town). Before parting
they entered a roadside inn. One of them, Ewen
M’Corkindale, had, after leaving, to pass through the
Beard gateway and the haunted dell. His companions
made fun of him, and asked him if he was not afraid
of the <i>Bodach</i>, the carle, or old man, who haunted the
dell. Out of fool-hardiness, Ewen proposed “the
health of the <i>bodach</i>, the old man, and let the <i>cailleach</i>,
the old wife, go to the dogs.” When he reached the
haunted spot two apparitions, an old man and an old
woman, met him. The old woman endeavoured to
attack him, but the old man kept her off, and ever
after, at every opportunity, the same scene was rehearsed,
the old wife attacked him and the old man
defended him. The latter also told him to go to a
smithy in Ireland, others say to two brothers in Cantyre,
and get a dirk made, and as long as he kept this
on his person the old woman would not venture to
attack him. The dirk bent three times in the making,
and from its possession Ewen acquired the title of
“Ewen of the Dirk” (<i>Eoghan na biodaig</i>). As he was
working one evening by moonlight in the harvest field,
he left the dirk on a stook of corn, along with his vest.
The carlin wife got between him and the dirk, and
gave him such a squeeze that he put out three mouthfuls
of blood. The <i>bodach</i> came, but too late, to his
rescue. It however, told him, that if he survived till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
cock-crowing, five years would be added to his life.
Ewen woke up now and then to ask if the cock crew
yet, but when it did it was too late. Very likely the
poor man died of some rupture or heart disease. The
dirk was preserved by his son.</p>

<h3>THE HEADLESS BODY (<i>Colann gun cheann</i>).</h3>

<p>At the shore and forming part of the boundary
between North and South Morar,<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> on the west coast
of Inverness-shire, there is a large rocky mound (<i>cnoc
mòr creige</i>), which was long the cause of terror in
the district. At the base of the mound a road can
be taken along the shore when the tide is out. No one,
however, taking it alone after nightfall, lived to tell the
tale. His remains were found next day among the
large boulder stones (<i>eòmach mòr chlach</i>), of which the
shore is full, mangled, and bearing traces of a ghastly
and unnatural death. Persons who had the second
sight looking over the rocks that overhang the shore
said they saw a phantom or “something” haunting
the place, having the shape of a headless human figure.
Macdonall or MacCuïl, as he is styled, of South
Morar (<i>Mac Dhughaill mhòrair</i>), whose house was not
far from the scene of the Headless Body’s violence,
unexpectedly became the means of expelling it from
its haunt. He was one winter evening unexpectedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
visited by a friend. He had no one to send to
Bracara across the river, to invite some more friends to
come and join in the entertainment of his guest but
his son and heir, then about 18 years of age. He
strictly enjoined the youth not to return that night
unless men came with him, for fear of the Headless
Body. The young man did not find the friends he
was sent for at home, and with the temerity natural to
his years came back alone. The Body met him and
killed him, and in the morning were found traces of
a fearful struggle, large stones displaced and clots
of blood, as if the youth had put out his heart’s blood.
MacCuïl made a solemn vow neither to eat nor drink
till he avenged his son’s death. All that evening his
friends tried to persuade him to remain at home, but
to no purpose. The Headless Body never appeared
but to those who passed its way alone, and the chief’s
friends had to return while he went on unaccompanied
to the haunted rocks. The Body came out and said,
“You have come to take your son’s ransom (<i>éiric</i>); take
counsel, and go home.” To this the chief replied by
clasping his arms round the hated apparition. A furious
struggle commenced, and to this day the stones may
be seen which were rolled out of their way in the dread
encounter. At last the strong and fearless chief got
the Headless Body under, and drew his dirk to stab it.
The Body cried, “Hold your hand, MacCuïl, touch
me not with the iron, and while there is one within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
twentieth degree related to you (<i>air an fhicheadamh
miar</i>) in Morar, I will not again be seen.”</p>

<p>When this story was heard some years ago there
were only two alive within this relationship to the
ancient chief, one a harmless idiot, the other a poor
woman in Fort William. One or other of them must
be still alive, for the Headless Ghost has not yet made
its reappearance. The person from whom it was
heard, was a firm believer in its truth, and in his
youth, half a century ago, was well acquainted with the
district in which the events were said to have occurred.
He had learned and practised the tailoring trade
there.</p>

<p>Another, and somewhat different, version of the tale
will be found in Campbell’s <i>West Highland Tales</i>, ii.
89. In it the subduing of the ghost is ascribed to
Stout John, Laird of Raasay, a proof of the manner in
which floating popular tales attach themselves to
known characters. The words ascribed to the Body
as it went away, were composed in the East Indies
by a piper of the name of Bruce from East-side, Skye.
<i>Beinn Heidera</i> and <i>Bealach a Bhorbhain</i> are both in
East-side, Skye. The words are an adaptation of an
old tune, “<i>Thogainn fonn air gille an t-sealgair</i>.”</p>

<p>The tale quoted by Scott (<i>Lay of the Last Minstrel</i>
note Q) from Henry the Minstrel, of Sir William
Wallace’s encounter with the Headless Body is also
known in the Hebrides, and has been told to the writer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
by a native of the extreme west of Tiree. According
to this version, Macfadyen’s head was cut off by
Wallace to avoid his falling alive into the hands of the
English. Macfadyen was an old man and not able
to keep up with the rest of the retreating company.
When Wallace himself went to open the door, the
Headless Body stood holding the head by the hair
in its hand, and threw it at Wallace. Wallace picked
it up and flung it out at the door as far as he could.
The Headless Body went in search of it and Wallace
made his escape by a window on the opposite side
of the castle.</p>

<p>There is a rhyme with which probably some legend
was formerly connected:</p>

<h3>THE GREY PAW (<i>Spòg liath</i>).</h3>

<p>In the big church of Beauly (<i>Eaglais mhor na
manachain</i>, <i>i.e.</i> of the Monastery) mysterious and unearthly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
sights and sounds were seen and heard at
night, and none who went to watch the churchyard
or burial-places within the church ever came back alive.
A courageous tailor made light of the matter and laid
a wager that he would go any night, and sew a pair of
hose in the haunted church. He went and began his
task. The light of the full moon streamed in through
the windows, and at first all was silent and natural.
At the dead hour of midnight, however, a big ghastly
head emerged from a tomb and said, “Look at the old
grey cow that is without food, tailor.”<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The tailor
answered, “I see that and I sew this,” and soon found
that while he spoke the ghost was stationary, but when
he drew breath it rose higher. The neck emerged and
said, “A long grizzled weasand that is without food,
tailor.”<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The tailor went on with his work in fear,
but answered, “I see it, my son, I see it, my son, I see
that and I sew this just now.”<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> This he said drawling
out his words to their utmost length. At last his voice
failed and he inhaled a long breath. The ghost rose
higher and said, “A long grey arm that is without
flesh or food, tailor.”<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> The trembling tailor went on
with his work and answered, “I see it, my son, I see it,
my son; I see that and I sew this just now.” Next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
breath the thigh came up and the ghastly apparition
said, “A long, crooked shank that is without meat,
tailor.” “I see it, my son, I see it, my son; I see
that and I sew this just now.” The long foodless and
fleshless arm was now stretched in the direction of
the tailor. “A long grey paw without blood or flesh,
or muscles, or meat, tailor.”<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The tailor was near done
with his work and answered, “I see it, my son, I see
it, my son; I see that and I sew this just now,” while
with a trembling heart he proceeded with his work.
At last he had to draw breath, and the ghost, spreading
out its long and bony fingers and clutching the air in
front of him, said, “A big grey claw that is without
meat, tailor.”<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> At that moment the last stitch was
put in the hose, and the tailor gave one spring of
horror to the door. The claw struck at him and the
point of the fingers caught him by the bottom against
the door-post and took away the piece. The mark of
the hand remains on the door to this day. The tailor’s
flesh shook and quivered with terror, and he could cut
grass with his haunches as he flew home.</p>

<p>This is perhaps the most widely known and most
popular story in the Highlands. Its incidents can be
reproduced on a winter evening with frightful
distinctness by means of a shadow on the wall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
This gives it a wonderful attraction for children,
and if fear can under any circumstances be called
into healthy action (and dread, like any other power
or capacity of the mind must have a proper and
healthy action), it is in listening to this or similar
stories. Their baneful effects, if such there be, soon
disappear. There is hardly an old church in the
Highlands, where the event has not been said to
have occurred. A writer in the last statistical account
(Argyleshire, p. 682 note) claims it for the old church
of Glassary. In Skye it is placed in the <i>Eaglais
Uamhalta</i> in Conasta near Duntulm. The old church
of Beauly has the most popular claim, though to
a youthful audience the truth of the story is much
confirmed by putting the scene in some place that they
know.</p>

<p>In the cathedral of Iona, there is a small nook
pointed out, called “the tailor’s hole” (<i>Toll an taìllear</i>),
where it is said the monks kept the tailor who made
their clothes. They kept him too long, and too busy
at his work, and at last “things” began to trouble him
at night. The worst of these was a fleshless hand
that used to show itself on the wall, and say, “a great
grey paw that is without meat, tailor.”</p>

<p>Another form of the tale is that the tailor was at the
<i>aire chlaidh</i>, <i>i.e.</i> watching the graveyard, of a friend, in
a chapel (<i>caibeal</i>) when the foodless figure began to
emerge from a tomb. The tailor did not run away till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the figure had got up as far as the knees, and said:
“<i>Sliasaid liath reamhar</i>,” etc.</p>

<h3>EWEN AND THE CARLIN WIFE.</h3>

<p>One of the commonest of Gaelic sayings is,
“Whether he would or not, as the old wife came upon
Ewen,” to which is frequently added, “a wife as big as
his mother” (<i>a dheòin no dh’aindeoin, mar thainig a
chailleach air Eoghan, bean cho mòr ri mhathair</i>). There
are various versions of the origin of this tale, but none
of them common.</p>

<p>The celebrated Ewen Cameron of Locheil (who is
characterised by Macaulay, in his <i>History of England</i>, as
the Ulysses of the Highlands, a gracious master, a
trusty ally, and a terrible enemy), was on a journey, as
the story goes, from Aberdeen to Inverness. He was
at the time a young man, and on entering the inn, in
which he stayed at Aberdeen, the evening before
starting, he found sitting before him an old woman he
had never seen before. On seeing Ewen she wrinkled
up her nose, tossed her head, and said “hĭh.” Ewen,
being of a witty humour, replied by wrinkling up his
own nose, tossing his head, and saying “hŏh.” Next
morning when starting, he found the hag waiting for
him at the door. She said, “Step it out, Ewen”
(<i>Ceum ann, Eoghain!</i>) He said nothing, but went on
his way. All day the old woman walked alongside,
and, whenever his steps flagged, repeated her challenge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
to him to step it out. Ashamed to be beat by an old
woman, and agile as a wild cat, Ewen held on at a
headlong pace, and before nightfall the pair were in
Inverness, 108 miles away. Ewen was sadly fatigued,
as may well be supposed from the distance and the
pace. That night he consulted an old man, who
advised him to answer the old wife’s challenge also in
words, and no evil would result from his walk. Next
day the hag, as before, was waiting for him at the
door, and said, “Step it out, Ewen” (<i>Ceum ann,
Eoghain!</i>) He answered: “A step for your step, and
a step additional, old woman!” (<i>Ceum air do cheum,
agus ceum a bharrachd, a chailleach!</i>) This day they
walked to Patrickson Sound (<i>Caolas ’ic Phadruig</i>), as
the ferry across Loch Leven at Balachulish is called, a
distance of 75 miles. Ewen got into the ferry boat
first, and pushed off from the shore. When the hag
saw herself about to lose him, she called out, “My
sincere wishes are yours, Ewen” (<i>Mo dhùrachd dhut
fhéin, Eoghain!</i>) He replied: “Your sincere wishes
be upon your own sides, and on yonder grey stone, old
wife!” (<i>Rùn do chridh’ air do chliathaich ’s air a chloich
ghlais ud thall, a chailleach</i>). The old wife looked at
the grey stone, and it split in two, as may still be seen
by any one passing that way.</p>

<p>Another version of the parting of Ewen and the Old
Wife is, that the pair came to Ewen’s foster-mother’s
house. That night his foster-mother put him to sleep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
on a hard deal board, and placed a crock of butter<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> to
his feet, while she put the old wife in a soft and
luxurious bed. In the morning Ewen was as fresh as
a lark, his feet had soaked in the whole of the butter
during the night, but the Carlin wife was dead!</p>

<p>Another, and probably older, tale of the origin of the
saying, is of a wilder cast. Ewen was a jolly young
fellow (<i>óganach grinn</i>) who went to a wedding. He
had a switch in his hand, with which, when the ceremony
was being performed in the church, he tapped a
skull in the church window, saying to it every word the
minister said to the couple marrying. That night on
going to bed he was seized by a shivering cold, and an
old woman (<i>cailleach</i>) came and claimed him as her
husband. She said, they were married as surely as the
couple in church that day. She came night after night,
and Ewen, whose thoughtless fun had turned to such
terrible earnestness, could not get rid of her, do what
he could. An old man, whom he consulted, said, there
was a bad chance of her going away while he lived, but
that he ought to consult Michael Scott. Michael said,
“I will separate you from her, but perhaps you will not
live after. Here is a book, which you are to take to
bed with you, and when she goes away, open the book,
and follow her wherever she goes. While the book is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
open, she cannot leave you by walking. Before you
come back, you will see the bed prepared for me, and
will be able to tell me what it is like.” The hag went
to hell, and Ewen followed.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Several subordinate
demons came first to the door, but Ewen demanded an
interview with their chief. He then requested, that the
old wife should be bound with chains, to keep her
always in her infernal abode. This was done, but when
he offered to go away, she followed. She was then put
below a caldron (<i>fo bhial coire</i>) on the bed of brimstone
prepared for Michael Scott, and she is probably there
still. Ewen came back to tell Michael, that his bed
was ready, and did not live long after his terrible adventure.</p>

<h3>THE BLACK WALKER OF THE FORD.</h3>

<p>Rather more than a century ago,<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> there lived at
Amhulaich, in Rannoch, a miller, much addicted to the
use of tobacco, and when unable to get it, was like most
smokers very short and quick in the temper. On one
occasion, he ran out of tobacco, and sent for a supply
by some Lochaber men, who were passing through
Rannoch on their way to Perth. The mill-stream ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
close to his house, and he had to cross it on stepping
stones in going to and from the mill. As he was returning
home one evening in the dusk, and was about
to enter the house, he heard the sound of footsteps
coming to the ford. He called out, who is there? but
received no answer. Being crusty for want of tobacco,
and thinking it might be the Lochaber men returning,
he called out a second time, very peremptorily and
impatiently. He still received no answer. He called
out a third time, turning down to the ford, and saying
aloud, that, whether it was man or devil, he would
make it answer. The thing then spoke, and said it (or
he) was the Black Walker of the Ford (<i>Coisiche du beul
an àth</i>). What further passed between the two never
transpired, but every evening after that, for a year or
more, the miller left home at dusk, crossed the stream,
and went to a small clump of trees about half a mile
away, whence loud cries and yells were heard during
the night. Before daybreak he came home, with his
knife or dirk covered with blood. When examined by
the light, the blood proved to be merely earth. An
attempt was made on one occasion by some young men
to follow him to the rendezvous, but he became aware
in some mysterious way of the attempt, and turning
back warned them not to follow. It was enough, he
said, for himself to go, without their perilling their souls.
On the last night of his going to meet the Black
Walker, such terrific outcries were heard from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
clump of trees, that the people of the neighbouring
villages, Amhulaich and Cragganoür, came to the doors
to listen. It was a winter night, and next morning
marks of a foot or knee were found in the snow, along
with the miller’s own footsteps, as if something had
been engaged in a struggle with him. Some years after
this, a man, who had been away in America, entered
Amhulaich Mill. The miller at the time was dressing
the mill-stone, and whenever he observed the American,
threw at him the pick he had in his hand, and nearly
killed another, who was standing near. He told him
never to appear in his presence again, that he had had
enough of him. Many surmised it was this man, who
had troubled him before, but whether it was or not
never appeared.</p>

<h3>STROWAN, ATHOLE.</h3>

<p>Within the present century, a native of Glen Erochty
(<i>Gleann Eireachdaidh</i>), the valley that leads from Athole
to Rannoch, was similarly afflicted. Every evening he
went to meet the evil spirit, at a small circle of trees,
on the top of the hill above the clachan of Strowan.
The last occasion of his doing so, was after the shinty
playing on New-Year’s day. He took with him a large
stick, which had been cut that same day in the wood,
and had served one of the players for a shinty stick.
Next day this stick was found at the scene of the
nightly meetings, twisted like a withe, while all round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
within a circle the snow was trampled, as if there had
been a struggle. There were marks of a man’s foot
and of a knee.</p>

<h3>THE UNEARTHLY WHISTLE.</h3>

<p>About seventy years ago, a young man, a native of
the village of Cornaig, in Tiree, went in the evening to
another village, <i>Cruaidh-ghortain</i>, about two miles distant.
When he reached it, he reclined on a bed, and
being tired fell fast asleep. He awoke with a start,
and thinking from the clearness of the night (it was
full moon) daylight had come, hurried off home. His
way lay across a desolate moor, called the Yellow
Ridge (<i>Druim Buidhe</i>), and when halfway he heard a
loud whistle behind him, but in a different direction
from that in which he had come, at a distance, as he
thought, of above a mile. The whistle was so unearthly
loud, he thought every person in the island must have
heard it. He hurried on, and when opposite the Sharp-pointed
Rock (<i>An Carragh biorach</i>) he heard the
whistle again, as if at the place where he himself had
been when he heard it first. The whistle was so clear
and loud, that it sent a shiver through his very marrow.
With a beating heart he quickened his pace, and when
at the gateway adjoining the village he belonged to,
he heard the whistle at the Pointed Rock. He here
made off the road, and managed to reach home before
being overtaken. He rushed into the barn, where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
usually slept, and, after one look towards the door at
his pursuer, buried himself below a pile of corn. His
brother was in a bed in the same barn asleep. His
father was in the house, and three times, with an
interval between each call, heard a voice at the door
saying, “Are you asleep? Will you not go to look at
your son? He is in danger of his life, and in risk of
all he is worth” (<i>an geall na’s fhiach e</i>). Each call
became more importunate, and at last the old man rose
and went to the barn. After a search he found his son
below a pile of sheaves, and nearly dead. The only
account the young man could give was, that when he
stood at the door, he could see the sky between the
legs of his pursuer, who came to the door and said
it was fortunate for him he had reached shelter; and
that he (the pursuer) was such a one who had been
killed in the Field of Birds (<i>Blàr nam Big-ein</i>) in the
Moas, a part of Tiree near hand.</p>

<p>In its main outline, this tale may be correct enough.
A hideous nightmare or terror had made the fatigued
young man hide himself under the corn, and things as
strange have happened, in the history of nervous
delusions, as that he should have gone himself to the
door of the dwelling house to call his father.</p>

<h3>THE BATTLE OF GAURA.</h3>

<p>This was the battle in which Cairbre and Oscar, the
son of Ossian, were killed. It was fought in Ireland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
about the fifth century, and from the poem or ballad, in
which Ossian describes the battle and the circumstances
of his son’s death, and which is still extant in popular
tradition, has always been the most celebrated of Celtic
battles. Macpherson has worked up the popular
accounts in the first Book of Temora, but not very
successfully.</p>

<p>One night a little man, of the name of Campbell,
was going home from the smithy, with the ploughshare
and coulter on his shoulder, and in a narrow glen
encountered a gigantic figure, that stood with a foot
resting on each side of the valley. This figure asked
him, “What is your name?” He answered boldly (as
became one of the clan), “Campbell.” It then asked,
“Were you at the Battle of Gaura?” He answered
“Yes.” “Show me your hand, then, that I may know
if you were at the Battle of Gaura.” Instead of his
hand, Campbell held out the ploughshare and coulter,
and the figure grasped them so tightly, that they were
welded together and had to be taken back to the
smithy, to be separated. “I see,” said the apparition,
“that you were at the Battle of Gaura, for your hand
is pretty hard.”</p>

<p>Two men were during the night on their way, it is
said, to steal sheep. One beguiled the way by telling
the other about the Battle of Gaura. Two figures of
immense size appeared, one on the top of each of two
high hills in the neighbourhood. The gigantic apparitions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
spoke to each other, and one said, “Do you hear
these men down there? I was the second best hero
(<i>ursainn chath</i>, lit. door-post of battle) at the Battle of
Gaura, and that man down there knows all about it
better than I do myself.”</p>

<h3>THE BEAST OF ODAL PASS.</h3>

<p>From Kyle-rhea (<i>Caol-Redhinn</i>), the narrowest part
of the Sound of Skye, the Pass of Odal stretches westward
and forms one of the most striking Pass views in
the Highlands. It was through it, that the first public
road was made in Skye, about sixty years ago. At
the time it was being made, the Pass was haunted by
“something” awful—the more awful that its character
was not distinctly known,—that enjoyed an evil reputation
far and wide as “The Beast of Odal Pass” (<i>Biasd
Bealach Odail</i>). This thing, whatever it was, did
not always appear in the same shape. Sometimes
it bore the form of a man, sometimes of a man with
only one leg; at other times it appeared like a greyhound,
or beast prowling about; and sometimes it was
heard uttering frightful shrieks and outcries, which
made the workmen leave their bothies in horror. It
was only during the night it was seen or heard.
Travellers through the Pass at night were often thrown
down and hurt by it, and with difficulty made their
way to a place of safety. It ceased when a man was
found dead at the roadside, pierced with two wounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
one on his side and one on his leg, with a hand
pressed on each wound. It was considered impossible
these wounds could have been inflicted by human
agency.</p>

<h3><i>Luideag</i>, “THE RAG.”</h3>

<p>At a small loch between Broadford and Sleat, in
Skye, called “The Lakelet of Black Trout” (<i>Lochan nan
dubh bhreac</i>), thirty or forty years ago, the figure of a
young woman with a coat about her head was commonly
to be seen at night in the neighbourhood of and
on the public road that passes that way. She went by
the name <i>Luideag</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the Rag, or slovenly female.
She did not answer when spoken to, and disappeared
as silently and mysteriously as she made her appearance.
The place is lonely and far from houses, and
there was no conceivable reason why any one, much
less a female, should nightly frequent it. An excise-man
passing the way once spoke to <i>Luideag</i>, first
in English and then in Gaelic, but she answered
not a word. A man was found lying dead on
the road at the place, and she never appeared afterwards.</p>

<h3><i>Lochan Doimeig.</i></h3>

<p>On the skirts of Schiehallion, the steepest and one
of the highest hills in the kingdom, there is a small
loch or tarn, near Crossmount, in Lower Rannoch, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
vicinity of which about 50 years ago was the scene of
strange terrors at night. The road leading over the
shoulder of the hill to Weem lay along the shores of this
lake, and, where it was crossed by a small stream that
falls into the loch, those who passed the way after dark
were scared by strange sights. After crossing the
ford the traveller was accompanied for about twenty
yards by a dog, a he-goat, a dark moving mass, or
some other object, which, from the unaccountable
manner of its appearance and disappearance, could
not be deemed earthly. A native of Kilchonan, in
Rannoch, who had been for some time in the south as
a gardener, came on a visit to his friends, and had to
pass in the neighbourhood of the loch. It was ascertained
that at Cashieville (<i>Cois-a-bhile</i>), where he left
the strath of the Tay to cross the skirts of Schiehallion,
he had taken a drink of porter. It was fourteen days
after before it was ascertained he never reached Kilchonan.
A search was instituted; men gathered from
Appin and Athole and Rannoch, and the whole country
round about, and continued the search for three or four
days, even as far as Glenlyon, but without success.
One of the exploring parties when above Crossmount
was met by a woman, who advised them to search
round <i>Lochan Doimeig</i>, for she had dreamt last night
she was cutting rushes there. Soon after a man met
them, who gave them the same advice, and said he had
had the same dream. On going round the loch they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
found the dead gardener lying on a green mound on
the brink of the stream, already mentioned as crossing
the road, in the attitude in which he had stretched himself
to take a drink.</p>

<h3>RETURN OF THE DEAD.</h3>

<p>A former minister of East-side, Skye, was in his
lifetime addicted to visiting his cattle fold. His whole
heart was given to his herds, and after his death his
ghost was to be seen revisiting his former haunts. An
old man undertook to meet and lay the ghost. The
two met and saluted each other in the usual manner.
When shaking hands, however, the man, instead of his
hand, offered the ploughshare. After that the ghost
never came back.</p>

<p>In the same neighbourhood, about thirty years
ago, a man died suddenly. His wife watched the cows
in harvest soon after this, lest they should leave the
fank or enclosure, in which they were put at nights to
keep them from wandering into the crops. She had
occasion one night to leave her charge and go to a
shop two miles away. On her return she went to close
a gap (<i>beàrn</i>) in the fold (<i>buaile</i>). She found there
her late husband, who told her not to be anxious, as he
was watching in her stead. Every night after this he
was visible to anyone who chose to go and look for
him. He even came to the house to <i>ceilidh</i>, <i>i.e.</i> to
while away the time, a favourite recreation in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Highlands (λέσχη of the ancient Greeks) of spending
the evening, by gathering in a neighbour’s house to
listen to gossip and tales and idle talk. The dead
man’s attentions at last made the wife resolve to sell
all she had and go to America. On the day of the
sale the cattle could not be gathered; they seemed to
be taken possession of by an undefinable terror, and
the sale and projected emigration had to be abandoned.
A little bird hovering about was evidently the cause of
the wildness of the cattle. After this day the visits of
the dead man ceased.</p>

<h3>DONALD GORM’S GHOST.</h3>

<p>In 1616 a batch of West Highland and Island chiefs
were brought before the Privy Council in Edinburgh,
and bound over in restrictions as to the quantity of
wine they were respectively to use in their houses. The
narrative upon which the Privy Council proceeded is
quoted by Gregory (<i>History of the Western Highlands</i>,
p. 395): “The great and extraordinary excesse in
drinking of wyne, commonlie usit among the commonis
and tenantis of the Yllis is not only ane occasioun of
the beastlie and barbarous cruelties and inhumanities
that fallis oute amongis thame, to the offens and displeasour
of God, and contempt of law and justice;
but that it drawis numberis of thame to miserable
necessitie and povartie, sua they are constrainit, quhen
they want from their awne, to take from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
nichtbours.”<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Among these lawless and reckless chiefs was
Donald Gorm Mor (Big Blue Donald), of Sleat, in
Skye, the then Lord Macdonald of the Isles. He was
prevented from attending the Council by sickness, but
ratified all their proceedings. “He named Duntulm,
a castle of his family in Trouterness (in Skye), as his
residence; and six household gentlemen and an annual
consumption of four tun of wine was allowed him.”
He died that same year, and was succeeded by his
nephew, Donald Gorm Og (Young Blue Donald). So
far history; the following tradition is well known in
Skye:</p>

<p>Some family document went amissing, and its loss
was likely to be of serious consequence to young
Donald Gorm. At the same time the figures of
Donald Gorm Mor and two companions were repeatedly
seen on the road leading to Duntulm Castle.
Efforts were made to accost them, but the three figures
passed those who met them in some mysterious manner
without being noticed, and without giving any opportunity
of being accosted. They were then seen to
enter the castle. An old man of the neighbourhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
advised that seven staves of pine (<i>gathannan caol
giuthais</i>), according to others seven spindles of oak
(<i>seachd dealgun daraich</i>), with fire at their points, should
be taken, and entry be made into the room in which
the ghosts each day took up their quarters. This was
done, and the phantoms, Donald Gorm Mor and his
two companions, were found drinking. To give confidence
to the intruders, that they might hear his tale,
Donald said:</p>

<h3>TAIBHSE CHOIMHLIG.</h3>

<p>Peter Brown, at Dun Crosg, in Glen Lochy, hid
a ploughshare (<i>coltair</i>), and died without telling where.
In consequence his ghost long haunted a waterfall in
the neighbourhood (<i>Eas Choimhlig</i>), but no one had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the courage to speak to it and ascertain the cause of
its unrest. In every settled community, the ploughshare
is of greater value, though less glory is attached
to it than the sword or any other weapon, and in the
Highlands, the same terrors were attached to the
hiding of so useful an instrument, which afterwards,
and in a more commercial state of society, were believed
to follow the secreting of gold. The unhappy man
who hid it, and died without revealing his secret, could
not rest in his grave. Peter Brown’s ghost was commonly
seen as a roebuck (<i>boc-earba</i>), that followed
people passing the ravine of Coilig after dark, but also
as a horse, dog, man, etc., and disappeared only about
forty years ago. A weaver had the courage to meet it,
and had a long talk with it. He was told what would
happen to his family, and that his daughter, whose marriage
was then spoken of, would never marry. When
he returned home he took to his bed and never rose.
There is now a bridge where the ford was formerly,
and it was at the top of the bank above the ford the
ghost was seen. It once fought a strong man, and
the marks of the conflict long remained on the ground
and trees.</p>

<h3>KINGAIRLOCH, ARGYLESHIRE.</h3>

<p>A skiff was upset at Maodlach, the most rugged
part of the coast of this rugged district. Of the two
men who formed its crew, one was saved by clinging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
to the boat, but the other, a powerful swimmer, in
trying to swim ashore, was drowned close to land. He
omitted to put off his shoes and got entangled in the
seaweed. Some time after his brother was coming
from the smithy late at night along the shore, carrying
an iron bolt on his shoulder. When opposite the place
where his brother’s body had been found, this man was
joined by a figure which, it was said, resembled a he-goat.
He had at the time two dogs along with him,
one of which cowered about his feet, but the other, a
bitch, leapt up at his throat, and he had again and
again to strike it down with the bolt he carried on his
shoulder. The figure spoke, but it never clearly transpired
what it said. It gave messages to deliver
to former associates, especially to one thoughtless
individual, warning him to amend in time. When the
brother reached a house and came to the light, he
fainted away.</p>

<h3>FLADDA-CHUAIN.</h3>

<p>In this islet, which lies on the east coast of Skye,
there lived at one time a native of Mull and his wife.
In the place there is a burying-ground called “The
Monks’ burial-ground” (<i>Cladh a Mhanaich</i>), the
existence of which adds much to the feelings of awe
natural to so lonely a place—a solitary islet several
miles from land in a stormy sea. A dead body came
on the shore, and was buried, after being stripped of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
clothes. After this the dead man came to the hut in
which the Mull man stayed regularly at midnight, and
sat warming himself at the fire which was left burning all
night on the floor. As he bent over the fire, and held
his feet and his hands to it, he said, “I will softly warm
myself, I will softly warm myself” (<i>Ni mi mo theóghadh
’s mo theóghadh</i>), and then add,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Wife, who took my trousers off,</div>
<div class="verse">And my nice black shoes from me,</div>
<div class="verse">And the shirt my sister gave me,—</div>
<div class="verse">To it, to it, cold feet of mine,</div>
<div class="verse">Many a sea you’ve traversed.”<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">After the Mull man left the place, a party of fishermen,
being in the neighbourhood, sent one of their number
ashore, Red-headed Donald (<i>Dòmhnull Ruadh</i>) to prepare
dinner for them in the bothy. As Donald was
bending down to kindle a fire, something struck him
violently on the skull and knocked him flat. Every
time he attempted to lift his head the thing knocked
him on the skull again. He felt sure it must be the
ghost which warmed itself at the Mull-man’s fire, the
<i>Teóghan</i> of which his companions had warned him.
Finding it would not allow him to rise, he lay on his
back as he had been knocked down, and, not daring to
look at his assaulter, wriggled himself along the floor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
till he got hold of a post, up which he clambered, to
hide himself among the rafters. When his companions
arrived the ghost was found to be a pet ram, addicted,
like its kind, to butting.</p>

<h3>HAUNTED HOUSES.</h3>

<p>Some half a century ago or more a native of Rannoch
resided at Bonskeid (<i>Bonn-sgaod</i>) in the neighbouring
parish of Blair Athole. He was married to a
Badenoch woman, who had brought servants with her
from her own country. In fact the only servants about
the house were from Badenoch. In obedience to the
law, which ascribes that which is mysterious to that
which is remote, Badenoch was at that time esteemed a
great place for witchcraft and things “uncanny.” A
series of unaccountable noises and appearances began
about the house in Bonskeid. Turnips and peats,
thrown by unseen hands, flew about the house, lights
were blown out, furniture was mysteriously moved,
bedclothes were pulled off, and no one could be sure
that an article would be found by him where he had
left it. In all this there was no appearance of mortal
agency, and the whole business was at once assumed to
be the work of evil spirits. A friend from Rannoch,
who had been on a visit to the house, declared solemnly
(and he was a God-fearing, trustworthy man) that he
himself heard the spinning-wheel coming down stairs,
and saw it falling in pieces on the floor of the room in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
which he and the family were sitting, without any visible
agency, and without any part of it being broken or
injured. He put it together again, and with his own
hands carried it upstairs and left it in its original place.
He had not sat long after coming down when the
wheel again came in the same mysterious manner, and
fell in pieces on the floor. On another occasion, as he
stood in the byre, a turnip came and knocked the
candle out of his hand. To his certain knowledge
there was no one in the byre who could have thrown it.
These flying turnips came sometimes as if they had
been hurled through the wall. The unhappy man, in
whose house this occurred, endured the persecution for
more than a year, and was sadly broken in health and
spirits by the trouble. One day as he stood on the
hearth-stone, warming the back of his feet to the fire,
the hearth-stone began to move. A Badenoch dark
hussy (<i>Caileag dhubh</i>) was at the time standing by, with
her elbow rested on the kitchen ‘dresser,’ and her chin
on her hand. He observed her smiling, and it struck
him she was at the bottom of all this bedevilment.
He turned her and all the rest of the Badenoch servants
away, and no further disturbance took place.</p>

<p>About twenty years ago, a house in Kilmoluag, Tiree,
was the scene of similar disturbances. With one or two
exceptions, all the people of the island believed them to
be produced by some supernatural evil agency, and all
the superstition that with the spread of education had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
been quietly dying out was revived in renewed vigour.
No one could deny the agency of spirits when the
evidence was so clear. The annoyance began by the
trickling of dirty water, mixed with sand, from the roof.
The burning peats were found among the bedclothes,
and pebbles in bowls of milk, where no peats or pebbles
ought to be; linen was lifted mysteriously from the
washing, and found in another room; articles of furniture
were moved without being touched by visible
hands, and stones flew about the house. The disturbances
did not occur during the day, nor when a
large company assembled at the house. Several went
to lay the ghost, and a good deal of powder and shot
was wasted by persons of undoubted courage in firing
in the air about the house. The annoyance became so
bad, and the advice of “wise people” so positive, that
the family removed to another house, in the hope the
evil would not follow. The removal, however, had no
effect, and it is privately rumoured, the disturbances
ceased only when some money that had gone amissing
was restored. The cause was never clearly ascertained,
but there is reason to suspect it was caused, as all
similar disturbances are, by some one suborned for the
purpose and shielded from suspicion by a pretended
simplicity and terror.</p>

<p>Numerous similar cases, which have occurred in the
Highlands, might be instanced. Instances occurring in
England, from that of Woodstock downwards, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
the south of Scotland, differ only as the circumstances
of the countries do. They all seem to have the same
characteristic, the tricks are such as it is perfectly
possible for human agency to perform, but it is believed
there is no human being about the place who does
them. Stones come flying through the windows, as if
they were thrown from the sky, and are found lying on
the floor; the leg of a wheelbarrow startles two persons
engaged within the house in earnest conversation, by
coming flying between them through the window, and
striking the opposite wall with violence; a peat strikes
the incredulous stranger between the shoulders, and he
goes home a believer, etc. These cantrips are exaggerated
by fear and rumour, till at last the devil is believed
to be unusually busy in the locality. Once this belief
becomes popular, the delusion is easily carried on.</p>

<h3><i>Bòcain</i>, GOBLINS.</h3>

<p>The number of these, resembling <i>Luideag</i>, seen about
fords or bridges, and near the public road in lonely
places, as has been already said, are numberless. Every
unusual sight and sound, in the locality which has the
name of being haunted, becomes a goblin to the
timorous, and one of the most tiresome forms of ghost
stories is, how the narrator was nearly frightened out
of his wits (the quantity of which is not mentioned) by
a horse standing with outstretched neck, and its head
towards him, which he mistook for a gigantic human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
figure, by a white he-goat in the face of a rock, the
plaintive cries of an owl, etc., etc. Most ghosts, however,
are dependent not so much on the imagination of
the individual spectator as on accumulated rumours,
and their explanation is to be sought in men’s love of
the marvellous and tendency to exaggeration. On the
high road leading from the wood of Nant (<i>Coill’ an
Eannd</i>) to Kilchrenan on Lochaweside, two or three
summers ago, the traveller was met by a dark shadow,
which passed him without his knowing how. On looking
after him, he again saw the shadow, but this time
moving away, and a little man in its centre, growing
less as the shadow moved off. The little man was
known as “<i>Bodach beag Chill-a-Chreunain</i>.”</p>

<p>About the same time a ghost haunted the neighbourhood
of Inveraray, and caused great annoyance to the
post and others travelling late. A man had a tussle
with a ghost at <i>Uchdan a Bhiorain dui</i> in Appin, and
said it felt in his arms like a bag of wool. Phantom
men were to be seen at <i>Uchdan na Dubhaig</i> above
Balachulish; at <i>Ath-flèodair</i>, a ford near Loch Maddy
in Uist, ‘things’ are perpetually seen, and it takes a
very courageous man to go from Portree home to Braes,
in Skye, after dark. A mile above the manse, where
the road is most lonely, and near the top of a gradual
ascent, sounds of throttling are heard and dark moving
objects are seen.</p>

<p>In the island of Coll, the top of the ascent above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Grisipol had at one time an evil reputation as a haunted
spot. At the summit of the pass, there is a white
round rock called <i>Cnoc Stoirr</i>. One night a man, on
his way to the west end of Coll, reached the place about
midnight, and was joined by a man on horseback.
The rider said not a word, and accompanied him for
near three miles to the “Round House,” as a house,
built for the accommodation of the farm-servants of
Breacacha Castle was called. Whenever he attempted
to enter any of the houses on the way, the silent horseman
came between him and the house and prevented
him. When they came to the Round House, the cock
crew, and the horseman disappeared over the gate in a
flame of fire. The man was lifted into the house,
pouring with sweat, and going off in fainting fits.</p>

<p>In Glen Lyon, in Perthshire, there is a village called
<i>Caisle</i>, and near it a ford (now a bridge) and ravine
called <i>Eas a Chaisle</i>. In the early part of the present
century, clods and stones were thrown by unseen hands
at parties crossing this ford at night. At last, no one
would venture to cross. A harum-scarum gentleman of
the neighbourhood, popularly looked upon as an unbeliever
and a man without fear of God or man, crossed
one night, and the clods as usual began to fly about
him. He cried out, “In the name of God I defy all
from the pit”; and on his saying this a mysterious
sound passed away up the ravine, and clod-throwing at
the place was never afterwards heard of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>The district, now forming the parishes of Kilmartin
and Kilmichael, at the west end of the Crinan Canal,
is known in the neighbourhood as Argyle (<i>Earra-ghaidheal</i>),
probably from a Celtic colony from Ireland
having settled there first. The people, for instance, of
Loch Aweside say of a person going down past Ford,
that he is going down to Argyle. In course of time
the name has been extended to the county. The public
road leading through the district was once infested by a
ghost, which caused considerable terror to the inhabitants.
A person was got to lay it. He met the
ghost and exorcised it in the name of Peter and Paul
and John and all the most powerful saints, but it never
moved. At last he called out peremptorily, “In the
name of the Duke of Argyle, I tell you to get out of
there immediately.” The ghost disappeared at once,
and was never seen again.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE CELTIC YEAR.</span></h2>

<p><i>Bliadhna</i>, a year, has been derived by writers on Celtic
antiquities from <i>Bel-ain</i>, “the ring or circle of Baal,”
but the derivation is at variance with etymological analogies,
as well as inadmissible from there being no
satisfactory evidence that Baalim worship ever extended
to the Celtic tribes. It can only be regarded as part of
that punning affectation with which Gaelic scholarship
is disfigured. The initial <i>bl</i> occurs in many words
which have in common the idea of <i>separation</i>, and
<i>bliadhna</i> is likely connected with such words as <i>bloigh</i>, a
fragment; <i>ball</i>, a spot, a limb, and denotes merely a
division, or separate portion, of time.</p>

<p>The notations of the Celtic year belong to the Christian
period, old style. If there are any traces of Pagan
times they are only such as are to be gathered from a
few names and ceremonies.</p>

<p>The four seasons are known as <i>earrach</i>, spring,
<i>samhradh</i>, summer, <i>fogharadh</i>, harvest, and <i>geamhradh</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
winter. The final syllable in each of these names is
<i>ràidh</i>, a quarter or season of the year, a space of three
months; and the student of Gaelic will note that the
long and heavy vowel, of which it consists, is, contrary
to the common rule affecting long vowels, shortened and
made an apparently indifferent terminal syllable. It is
still deemed, in many parts of the Highlands, unlucky
to be proclaimed in one quarter of the year and married
in the next, and the circumstance is called being
“astride on the seasons” (<i>gobhlach mu’n ràidh</i>). It is
an old saying, that the appearance of a season comes a
month before its actual arrival; <i>mìos roi gach ràidh
choltas</i>, <i>i.e.</i> a month before each season, is seen its appearance.
The character of the seasons is described in
an old riddle,</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There can be no doubt the origin of the names given
to them belongs to a period anterior to Christianity.</p>

<p><i>Earrach</i>, spring, is derived from <i>ear</i>, the head, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
front, the east. In naming the four quarters of the
heavens, the face, as in the case of the Hebrew names,
is supposed to be toward the east. The right hand
(<i>deas</i>) is the name given to the south, and the adjective
<i>tuaitheal</i>, from <i>tuath</i>, the north, means “wrong, to the
left, against the sun.” Hence also, <i>toirt fo’n ear</i>, lit. to
take a thing from the east, means to observe; <i>earalas</i>,
foresight, <i>i.e.</i> the having a thing in view; <i>earar</i>, the day
after to-morrow, <i>i.e.</i> the day in front of it. The
Latin <i>bos</i>, and the Greek ἔας or ἦς would indicate that
the ancient Celtic name of the season was <i>fearrach</i>, and
if so it may be connected with <i>fear</i>, vir, a man, the first
<i>par excellence</i>, <i>for</i>, before, <i>furasda</i>, easy, etc. <i>Eàrr</i>
means the tail, and the long syllable shows it to be
only another form of <i>iar</i>, west, behind, after, the opposite
of <i>ear</i>. Frequently these names for east and west
are known as <i>sear</i> and <i>siar</i>, as <i>e.g.</i> <i>cha-n fhearr an gille
shiar na’n gille shear</i>, “the lad from the west is no
better than the lad from the east,” that is, it is but six
of the one and half a dozen of the other.</p>

<p><i>Samhradh</i>, summer, according to old glossaries, is
from obs. <i>samh</i>, the sun, and means the sun season or
quarter. This corresponds with the English name,
which is evidently a softened form of <i>sun-mer</i>. <i>Samh</i>
is now used to denote “the suffocating smell produced
by excessive heat.”<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> In Tiree, it is the name given to
the hazy heavy appearance of the Western ocean, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
few expressions are more common than <i>samh chuain
t-siar</i>, the oppressive feeling of which the uneasy sea
on the west side of the island is productive. In the
North Hebrides <i>samh</i> means the ocean itself. A
common description over the whole Highlands of an
intolerable stench is <i>mharbhadh e na samhanaich</i>, <i>i.e.</i> it
would kill the savage people living in caves near the
ocean, as giants were fabled to do.</p>

<p><i>Fogharadh</i>, autumn, is likely connected with <i>fogh</i>,
said to mean ease, hospitality, and <i>foghainn</i>, to suffice,
with the same root idea of <i>abundance</i>.</p>

<p><i>Geamhradh</i>, winter; Lat. <i>hiems</i>, Gr. χεῖμα. No doubt
<i>geamh</i> is of the same origin as the Greek and Latin
words, but it does not find its explanation in the Greek
χεω, to pour. From its being found in <i>gèamhlag</i>, a
crow-bar, <i>gèimheal</i>, a chain, <i>geamhtach</i>, short, stiff, and
thick, there seems to have been a Gaelic root implying
to bind, to be stiff, which gives a suitable derivation for
the name of the season of frost and ice.</p>

<p><i>Mios</i>, a month, is supposed to be connected with
<i>mias</i>, a round platter, from the moon’s round orb completing
its circle within the month. Greek μήν, Eol.
μεις, a month; Lat. <i>mensis</i>; Sanscr. <i>mâsas</i>, a month, <i>mâs</i>,
the moon. These show that undoubtedly the origin of
the word is connected with the moon. The names in
the Greek, Latin, and Teutonic languages show that
there was originally an <i>n</i> in the word, and the Gaelic,
as well as Sanscrit, bears testimony to the same fact, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
the long vowel. It is a common thing in Hebrew for <i>n</i>
at the end of a syllable and in the middle of a word to
be assimilated to an immediately succeeding consonant,
and it is more likely it so disappeared in some
languages than that it was assumed by others. Another
Gaelic name for the moon, <i>ré</i>, is also used to denote a
portion of time; <i>ri mo ré</i>, during my lifetime.</p>

<p>Computation of time, however, by months and days
of the month, as at present, was entirely unknown to
the Highlander of former days; and even yet, the
native population do not say “on such a day of such a
month,” but so many days before or after the beginning
of summer or other season, or before and after
certain well-known term days and festivals, as St Bride’s
day, St Patrick’s day, Whitsunday (<i>caingis</i>), Hallowtide
(<i>Samhuinn</i>), etc. The time is always reckoned by the
old style, and this difference of notation is at first confusing
to a stranger. For instance, when told that the
ling fishing on the West Coast lasts from the middle of
spring till five weeks of summer, it will take a little
thought on his part to realise that this means from the
beginning of April to about the 18th of June. Names
for the months are to be found in dictionaries, but they
are obviously manufactured from the Latin names, and
confined to modern printed Gaelic.</p>

<p>A connected account of the festivals and days by
which the year was marked, must begin with the festivities
by which its advent was celebrated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<h3>NOLLAIG.</h3>

<p>The seven days from Christmas to the New Year
were called <i>Nollaig</i>, and in the good easy-going olden
times no work was done during them, but men gave
themselves up to friendly festivities and expressions of
goodwill. Hence the sayings, “The man whom Christmas
does not make cheerful, Easter will leave sad and
tearful,”<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and “There is no Christmas without flesh.”<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
Christmas day was called “the day of big Nollaig”
(<i>Latha Nollaig mhór</i>), and the night before it “the
night of Cakes” (<i>oidhche nam bannagan</i>); while New-Year
day was known as “the day of little Nollaig”
(<i>Latha Nollaig bhig</i>), and the night before it “the
night of blows” (<i>oidhche nan Calluinnean</i>).</p>

<p>The name <i>Nollaig</i> is from the Latin <i>natalis</i>, as is
made certain by the Welsh word being <i>Nadolig</i>; and
therefore corresponds to the English Christmas.
Various explanations are given of the name of the
night before it. Some say <i>bannag</i> means “a feast of
women,” from <i>bean</i>, a wife, a feast of rejoicing, such as is
customary when a child is born, being prepared by
women this evening in memory of the birth of Christ.
Others say the <i>bannag</i> is the cake presented by them
to every one who entered the house that night. If the
word means a cake, it is only applied to Christmas
cakes or those used on this day. When there was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
person of means, he took every one he met that
week, especially the poor, to his house, and gave him
his <i>bannag</i>, a large round cake (<i>bonnach mòr cruinn</i>).</p>

<p>New-Year’s night, or Hogmanay, was variously
known as “the night of the candle” (<i>oidhche Choinnle</i>)
and “the night of the blows or pelting” (<i>oidhche nan
Calluinnean, a Challuinn</i>). The former name may have
been derived from some religious ceremonies being
performed by candle-light, as is suggested to be
the origin of the English name Candlemas (2nd February),
or from a candle being kept lighted till the New
Year came in. The other name is said to be from the
showers of rattling blows given to a dry cow’s hide
used in the ceremonies of the evening, <i>colluinn</i> being
also used to denote a thundering blow, or what is
called in the Lowlands “a loundering lick” (<i>stràic
mhòr</i>). Thus, <i>thug e aon cholluinn air</i> (he gave him
one resounding blow); <i>bi tu air do dheagh cholluinneachadh</i>
(you will be severely beaten). The word,
however, as was long ago pointed out by Lhuyd
(<i>Archæologia Britannica</i>, 1707) is from <i>Calendae</i>, the
first day of every month, this being the beginning of
the whole year, and the night being in the Highlands
reckoned as preceding the day.</p>

<h3>CALLUINN.</h3>

<p>Towards evening men began to gather and boys ran
about shouting and laughing, playing shinty, and rolling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
“pigs of snow” (<i>mucan sneachda</i>), <i>i.e.</i> large snowballs.
The hide of the mart or winter cow (<i>seiche a mhairt
gheamhraidh</i>) was wrapped round the head of one of
the men, and he made off, followed by the rest, belabouring
the hide, which made a noise like a drum,
with switches. The disorderly procession went three
times <i>deiseal</i>, according to the course of the sun (<i>i.e.</i>
keeping the house on the right hand) round each house
in the village, striking the walls and shouting on
coming to a door:</p>

<p>Before this request was complied with, each of the
revellers had to repeat a rhyme, called <i>Rann Calluinn</i>
(<i>i.e.</i> a Christmas rhyme), though, as might be expected
when the door opened for one, several pushed their way
in, till it was ultimately left open for all. On entering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
each of the party was offered refreshments, oatmeal
bread, cheese, flesh, and a dram of whisky. Their leader
gave to the goodman of the house that indispensable
adjunct of the evening’s mummeries, the <i>Caisein-uchd</i>,
the breast-stripe of a sheep wrapped round the point of
a shinty stick. This was then singed in the fire
(<i>teallach</i>), put three times with the right-hand turn
(<i>deiseal</i>) round the family, and held to the noses of all.
Not a drop of drink was given till this ceremony was
performed. The <i>Caisein-uchd</i> was also made of the
breast-stripe or tail of a deer, sheep, or goat, and as
many as choose had one with them.</p>

<p>The house was hung with holly to keep out the
fairies, and a boy, whipped with a branch of it, may be
assured he will live a year for every drop of blood he
loses. This scratching and assurance were bestowed by
boys on one another, and was considered a good joke.</p>

<p>Cheese was an important part of the refreshments,
and was known as the Christmas cheese (<i>Càise Calluinn</i>).
A slice, cut off at this feast, or a piece of the rind (<i>cùl
na mulchaig</i>), if preserved and with a hole made
through it, has strange virtues. It was called
<i>laomachan</i>, and a person losing his way during the
ensuing year, in a mist or otherwise, has only to look
through the hole and he will see his way clearly. By
scrambling to the top of the house, and looking through
it down the <i>fàr-lus</i> (the hole in the roof that served in
olden times for chimney and window), a person can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
ascertain the name of his or her future husband or wife.
It will prove to be the same as that of the first person
seen, or heard named. A piece of <i>laomachan</i> is also
valuable for putting under one’s pillow to sleep over.</p>

<p>In this style the villagers, men and boys, went from
house to house, preceded in many cases by a piper,
and drowning the animosities of the past year in hilarity
and merriment.</p>

<h3>CHRISTMAS RHYMES (<i>Rann Calluinn</i>).</h3>

<p>In general the rhymes used, when seeking admittance,
varied but little in different districts. Sometimes
an ingenious person made a rhyme suitable to the place
and people, and containing allusions to incidents and
character that increased the prevailing fun. The following
is one of the most common of the class:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">And if you have room to move,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Rise and bring down the glass.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The following New-Year’s rhyme must have tried
the breath of the speaker and the patience of his listeners
considerably. It consists probably of several separate
rhymes tagged together, and the allusions it contains
to the “big clerk of the street,” etc., make it highly
probable the ceremonies of the evening were remains of
the Festival of Fools, and had their origin in the streets
of Rome. The rhyme is given as it came to hand.</p>

<h3>NEW-YEAR NIGHT.</h3>

<p>It was a practice not to be neglected to keep the fire
alive in the house all night. No one was to come near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
it but a friend, and, as an additional security against its
going out, candles were kept burning. Hence, the
other name given to the night, <i>Oidhche Choinnle</i>, <i>i.e.</i>
candle night. There was a rhyme (which the writer
has not been able to recover) to be said when feeding
the fire. By this means evil was kept away from the
house for the subsequent year. If the fire went out no
kindling could be got next day from any of the neighbours.
The first day of the year was a quarter-day, on
which it was unlucky to give fire out of the house. It
gave the means to witches and evilly-disposed people
to do irreparable mischief to the cattle and their produce.
The dying out of the fire was, therefore, a
serious inconvenience in days when lucifer matches
were unknown. The women made use of the occasion
to bake bread for next day.</p>

<p>Old men, provident of the future, watched with
interest the wind the old year left (<i>ghaoth dh’fhàgas a
Choluinn</i>). That would prove the prevailing wind
during the ensuing year, and indicated its chief characteristics,
as the rhyme says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<h3>NEW-YEAR’S DAY</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Latha na Bliadhn’ ùr</i>); also called the Day of Little
Christmas (<i>Latha nollaige bige</i>).</p>

<p>On getting up in the morning the head of the family
treated all the household to a dram. After that a
spoonful of half-boiled sowens (<i>cabhruich leth-bhruich</i>),
the poorest food imaginable, was given for luck. Sometimes
the sowens were whole boiled, and in some places
the well-to-do farmer’s wife left a little over night at the
house of every poor man on the farm. The custom of
having this dish of sowens was known in the central
Highlands, and in Lorn, but does not seem to have extended
to Mull, Morven, or the Western Islands. The
salutations of the season were duly given by the household
to one another, and to every person they met: “A
good New Year to you” (<i>Bliadhna mhath ùr dhuit</i>),
“The same to you, and many of them” (<i>Mar sin duit
fhein is mòran diu</i>). The boys rushed away out, to
play at their everlasting game of shinty, and a more
sumptuous breakfast than ordinary was prepared.</p>

<p>Nothing was allowed to be put out of the house this
day, neither the ashes of the fire nor the sweepings of
the house, nor dirty water, nor anything else, however useless,
or however much in the way. It was a very serious
matter to give fire out of the house to a neighbour
whose hearth had become cold, as the doing so, as
already said, gave power to the evil-minded to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
away the produce from the cattle. Indeed it was
ominous that death would occur in the household within
the year. Hospinian tells that at Rome, on New-Year’s
Day, no one would allow a neighbour to take fire out
of his house, or anything composed of iron (Ellis’s
<i>Brand’s Antiquities</i>, i. 13).</p>

<p>It was unlucky for a woman to be the first to enter
the house, or if the person were empty-handed. A
young man entering with an armful of corn was an excellent
sign of the year’s prosperity; but a decrepit old
woman asking kindling for her fire was a most deplorable
omen. The same belief that some people are lucky
as first-foots led to the “curious custom” in the Isle of
Man known as the <i>Quaaltagh</i> (Ellis’s <i>Brand</i>, i. 538).
That word differs only in spelling from the Gaelic
<i>còmhalaich</i>, or <i>còmhaltaich</i>, a person, the meeting of
whom is ominous of good or bad fortune. To ensure a
good omen, a party of young men went in every parish
in Man from house to house on New-Year’s Day singing
luck to the inmates. It was deemed an omen of good
to see the sun this day.</p>

<p>Towards mid-day the men gathered in some suitable
place, the largest and most level field in the neighbourhood,
for the great Shinty Match (<i>Iomain mhòr</i>). A
match was formed between adjoining districts and villages,
or, if the village itself was populous, by two
leaders, appointed for the purpose, choosing one alternately
from those present till the whole gathering was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
gone through. It was decided who was to choose first
by the one leader holding his shinty stick (<i>caman</i>) vertically,
or up and down, and throwing it to the other,
who caught somewhere about the middle. The two
then grasped the stick alternately, the hand of the one
being close above that of the other, and the one who
grasped the end, so that he could swing the stick three
times round his head, had the first choice. Sometimes,
to decide the point quickly, one asked the other which
he would have, “foot or palm” (<i>chas no bhas</i>), meaning
which end of the shinty stick he made choice of, the
“foot” being that by which the stick is held, the “palm,”
that with which the ball is struck. On a choice being
made the club was thrown into the air, and the matter
was decided by the point of it that pointed southwardly
more summarily than by the “heads and tails” of a
copper coin.</p>

<p>In the game a wooden ball (<i>ball</i>) was used in the
daytime, when men could guard themselves against
being struck by it; but when the game was played
at night, in the dusk or by moonlight, a ball of hair
or thread called <i>crìod</i> was used. The object of the
game was to drive this ball “hail” (<i>thaghal</i>), that is
between and beyond certain marks at the two ends of
the field. Of course the two parties had opposite
“hails.” The play commenced by setting the ball in a
suitable place, and giving the first blow, called <i>Buille
Bhàraich</i>, to the chief, proprietor, priest, minister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
or other principal person present. A player stood
opposite to him, and if the ball was missed at the first
blow, as sometimes happened from excessive deliberation,
want of skill and practice, etc., whipped it away
in the other direction, and, without further ceremony,
every person ran after it as he chose, and hit it as he
got opportunity. Two or three of the best players on
each side were kept behind their party, “behind hail”
(<i>air chùl taghail</i>), as in the game of football, to act as a
guard when their adversaries too nearly sent the ball
“home.” Sometimes the company was so fairly
matched that nightfall put an end to the sport without
either party winning “a hail.” Every player got as
much exercise as he felt inclined for. Some did little
more than walk about the field, others could hardly
drag themselves home at night with fatigue. Much
can be said in behalf of the game as the best of out-door
sports, combining healthy, and, when the player chooses,
strong exercise with freedom from horse-play.</p>

<p>A piper played before and after the game. The
women, dressed in their best, stood looking on. At the
end the chief, or laird, gave a dinner, or, failing him, a
number were entertained in the house of a mutual
friend. In the evening a ball was given, open to all.</p>

<p>New-Year’s Day, like the first of every quarter of the
year (<i>h-uile latha ceann ràidhe</i>), was a great <i>saining</i> day,
<i>i.e.</i> a day for taking precautions for keeping away evil
from the cattle and houses. Certain ceremonies were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
carefully observed by the superstitious; juniper was
burnt in the byre, the animals were marked with tar,
the houses were decked with mountain ash, and the
door-posts and walls, and even the cattle, were sprinkled
with wine.</p>

<p>By New-Year’s Day the nights have begun to shorten
considerably. It is a Gaelic saying that there is “an
hour of greater length to the day of little Christmas”
(<i>uair ri latha Nollaige bige</i>), and this is explained to be
“the hour of the fuel lad” (<i>uair a ghille chonnaidh</i>). The
word uair means “a time” as well as an hour; and the
meaning perhaps is, that owing to the lengthening of
the day the person bringing in firewood has to go one
trip less frequently for fuel to make a light.</p>

<p>Christmas Day (<i>La Nollaige mòire</i>) was said to
lengthen <i>fad coisichean coilich</i>, a cock’s stride or walk,
and the expression was explained to mean that the bird
had time to walk to a neighbour’s dunghill, crow three
times, and come back again.</p>

<p>The same sayings are current in the Highlands as in
the south. “A green Yule makes a fat kirkyard” has
its literal counterpart in <i>’S i Nollaig uaine ni an cladh
miagh</i> (<i>i.e.</i> <i>reamhar</i>) and in <i>’S blianach Nollaig gun
sneachda</i> (<i>i.e.</i> Lean is Yule without snow).</p>

<p>There is no reason to suppose that any Pagan rites
connected with the period of the winter solstice were
incorporated with the Yule or <i>Nollaig</i> ceremonies. The
various names connected with the season are of Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
origin; the superstitions, as that of refusing fire and
allowing nothing out of the house, can be traced to
Rome; the custom of a man dressing himself in a cow’s
hide, as suggested by Brand (i. 8), with every probability,
is a vestige of the Festival of Fools, long held in
Paris on New-Year’s Day, and of which it was part
that men clothed themselves in cow-hide (<i>vestiuntur
pellibus pecudum</i>). The holding of a singed piece of
skin to the noses of the wassailers is more likely to
have originated in the frolics of the same festival than
in any Pagan observance. The meaning of the custom
is obscure, but its character is too whimsical to be associated
with any Pagan rite.</p>

<h3>THE TWELVE DAYS OF CHRISTMAS.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Da latha dheug na Nollaig.</i>)</p>

<p>These were the twelve days commencing from the
Nativity or Big <i>Nollaig</i>, and were deemed to represent,
in respect of weather, the twelve months of the year.
Some say the days should be calculated from New-Year’s
Day. “Whatever weather there is on the twelve
days beginning with the last of December, the same will
agree with the weather in the corresponding month”
(Pennant). In Ireland the twelve days were held to
stand for the twelve Apostles, and “on Twelve Eve
in Christmas they used to set up as high as they can
a sieve of oats, and in it a dozen of candles all round,
and in the centre one larger, all lighted. This in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
memory of our Saviour and his Apostles, lights of the
world” (Brand, i. 25). The same, no doubt, was the
origin of the Highland notation. They are also looked
upon as the twelve days between old and new style.
There is evidence in the saying, that “an hour and a
half is added to Candle Day” (<i>uair gu leth ri Latha
Coinnle</i>), that some such custom was known of old in
Scotland as in Ireland; and though Candle Night
(<i>Oidhche Choinnle</i>) is now a name given to Christmas
night, there is a probability it originally denoted Twelve
Eve, or the Feast of the Epiphany.</p>

<h3>WINTER SEASON.</h3>

<p>The period during which the above festivities
occurred, and sometime before and after <i>Nollaig</i>, was
popularly known as “The Black cuttings of Christmas”
(<i>Gearra dubha na Nollaig</i>), from its liability to tempestuous
weather. The sky is then lowering and dark, the
“level” sun gives little warmth, and high winds prevail.</p>

<p>The <i>Dùlachd</i> of winter extended over the six weeks
preceding the middle of spring (<i>gu meadhon an Earraich</i>).
Some (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Highland Society’s Dict.</i>, <i>sub voce</i>) call it
<i>Dùbhlachd</i>, and translate it simply “wintry weather.”
Others call it <i>Dùdlachd</i>, and denote by it “the depth
of winter.” The word is a contraction of <i>duaithealachd</i>,
from <i>duaitheil</i>, extremely coarse and rough, an epithet
applied to stormy weather. Thus, <i>nach duaitheil an
t-sìd?</i> is it not desperately coarse weather? <i>Ceann<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
reamhar an duaithealais</i>, “the thick end of coarseness,”
denotes extremely rough usage.</p>

<p>Handsel Monday (<i>Di-luain an t-sainnseil</i>) was the
first Monday after New-Year’s Day, and was the
principal day in the whole year for <i>deachainn</i>, <i>i.e.</i> for
making trials and forecasts of the future. It derives its
name from <i>sainnseal</i>, Scot. handsel, a present or gift in his
hand given this day to every visitor to a house. <i>Sainnseal
sona</i> is “a happy or fortunate present.” In some
districts cock-fighting was practised in the schools, and
children brought a gratuity (in money) to the schoolmaster.
In other districts this was not the case till
Shrovetide (<i>Di-màirt Inid</i>).</p>

<p>In Skye the day is called <i>Di-luain Traosda</i>; and it
is from it the 12 days, corresponding in weather to the
12 months of the year, are computed.</p>

<h3>FEBRUARY (<i>Faoilleach</i>).</h3>

<p>The name <i>Faoilleach</i> is said to mean “Wolf-month,”
from <i>faol</i>, wild, whence also <i>faol-chu</i>, a wolf,
lit. a wild dog. It embraces the last 14 days of
winter and the first 14 days of spring, the former
being called the winter Faoilleach (<i>am Faoilleach
geamhraidh</i>), the latter the spring (<i>am Faoilleach Earraich</i>).
It is also known as “the Dead Month” (<i>a’
marbh mhiòs</i>). Winter is still ruling the inverted year,
and all nature seems to be dead. The trees have long
lost their foliage, the grass gives no sign as yet of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
returning growth, and fields and fallows are bare. When
over all there is a coating of snow the name of “Dead
Month” appears peculiarly appropriate. The time,
being reckoned by old style, corresponds almost exactly
to the present month of February, and the saying that
“every month in the year curses a fair February.” is
amply corroborated by the Gaelic sayings regarding it.
Old men liked it to commence with a heavy storm and
end with a calm, or (to use their own words) “to come
in with the head of a serpent and go out with a peacock’s
tail” (<i>tighinn a stigh le ceann na nathrach, ’s dol amach
le earball peucaig</i>). There are to be three days of calm
during it, according to the saying, “Three days of
August in February, and three days of February in
August” (<i>trì la Faoilleach san Iuchar, ’s trì la Iuchar
san Fhaoilleach</i>). Both the February calm and the
August storm, however, have become proverbial for
their uncertainty and short duration. “February calm
and August wind” (<i>Fia’ Faoilleach is gaoth Iuchar</i>) are
the most fickle things in the world. In the north it
was said mist in February means snow next day (<i>Ceò
san Fhaoilleach, sneachda maireach</i>). Old people said,
“Better the land be plundered than a calm morning in
February.”<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> The most unreasonable of expectations
is to expect black “brambles in February” (<i>smeuran
dubha san Fhaoilleach</i>).</p>

<p>It is unfortunate if the heat of this season is such, as
old men say they have seen it, that the cattle run with
the heat; but it is a healthy sign of the season if
men go about with their hands wrinkled with the cold
till they resemble an animal’s hoof, and kept in their
pockets (anciently belts) for warmth.</p>

<p>It was said to be as unnatural to hear thunder at this

(<i>laogh a geumraich am broinn a mhàthiar</i>).</p>

<h3><i>Earrach beag nam Faochag.</i></h3>

<p>“The little Spring of Whelks” is the period from
Christmas (<i>Nollaig</i>) to St Bride’s day, or beginning of
February. That species of shellfish is then at its best,
and the soup made from it, called <i>siabh</i> or <i>brochan
fhaochag</i>, was deemed as good as flesh.</p>

<h3>ST. BRIDE’S DAY.</h3>

<p>St. Bridget’s, or St. Bride’s day (<i>Feill Brìde</i>, <i>Brithid</i>)
is the first day of spring, consequently the middle of
the <i>Faoilleach</i>, the 1st of February, O.S., but the 13th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
New Style. It is frequently confounded with Candlemas,
but that day is the 2nd February, whereas St.
Bride’s Day is the 1st—this mistake is made by Martin
(<i>West. Isl.</i>, 1716, p. 119). He says that on the 2nd
of February “the mistress and servants of each family
take a sheaf of oats, and dress it up in woman’s apparel,
put it in a large basket, and lay a wooden club by it, and
this they call Briid’s Bed; and then the mistress and servants
cry three times, Briid is come, Briid is welcome”
(Brand, i. 56). The custom is long extinct in the parts
of the Highlands with which the writer is acquainted
and the only particulars connected with it he has heard
are, that on St. Bride’s Day a bed of birch twigs
(<i>leaba bharraich</i>) was made by the women, and that
they then cried at the door, “Bride, Bride, come in,
your bed is ready” (<i>Brìde, Brìde, thig astigh, tha do leaba
dean-te</i>).</p>

<p>As in the case of many Gaelic festivals, ceremonies,
and other antiquities, the origin of St. Bride’s Day is to
be traced directly to Ireland. St. Bridget, we are told,
was the first nun in Ireland, and founded her first cell
where the city of Kildare now stands, in 585. She was
a native of Ulster, and, after building monasteries and
performing miracles, became Patroness of Ireland. In
1185 her body was found in the same vault with those
of St. Patrick and St. Columba. A well near her
church in Fleet Street, London, gave its name, Bridewell,
to a palace given by Edward VI. to the city, for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
workhouse and a house of correction. The honoured
name of St. Bride, who during many ages was celebrated
for her sanctity and piety, has thus by accident
become associated with the criminal population.</p>

<p>It is a sign of the approaching spring that on this
day the raven begins to build, and larks sing with a
clearer voice. It has been explained in another part of
this work, that there was a belief, the serpent had to
come out of its hole seven days previous. The rhyme
regarding the raven ran:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“A nest on St. Bridget’s day,</div>
<div class="verse">An egg at Shrovetide,</div>
<div class="verse">And a bird at Easter;</div>
<div class="verse">If the raven have not these,</div>
<div class="verse">Then it dies.”<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The corrections of the observations which it embodies
is confirmed by White (<i>Nat. Hist. of Selborne</i>), who
gives Feb. 14-17 as the period at which the raven
builds.</p>

<p>In Tiree this was the day on which cock-fighting
was practised, and gratuities were given to the schoolmaster.
In the evening it was customary to have a
ball.</p>

<p>The period from <i>Nollaig</i> to <i>Feill Brìde</i>, was reckoned
at one month and three days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<h3>SPRING.</h3>

<p>The <i>Faoilleach</i> introduces a series of names,
peculiarly Celtic, and (so far as the writer is aware),
having no equivalents in any other language. The
divisions of time denoted by them extend to the
beginning of summer, each name, in accordance with
the genius of the Gaelic language, as shown in names
of places, nicknames, etc., is descriptive. Almanacs
have long superseded the ancient notations, and it is
not now an easy matter to arrange them in their proper
order, or to reconcile the accounts retained by tradition
with Almanac notation. The length of time ascribed
to each seems to have varied in different districts.</p>

<h3><i>Feadag</i>, THE WHISTLE,</h3>

<p class="noindent">succeeds immediately to the Wolf-month (<i>Faoilleach</i>),
though some place it before <i>Cailleach</i>, and about St.
Patrick’s day. In M’Leod and Dewar’s Dictionary it
is said to be the third week in February, which
reckoned by O.S. is from 1st to 8th March, N.S.
It is thus made to succeed the <i>Faoilleach</i>, and the same
seems the opinion of Hugh M’Lachlan, of Aberdeen, a
most learned and accomplished man. In a poem on
spring, he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Season in which comes the flaying Wolf-month,</div>
<div class="verse">Cold hail-stones, a storm of bullets,</div>
<div class="verse"><i>Feadag</i>, <i>Sguabag</i>, the <i>Gearran’s</i> gloom</div>
<div class="verse">And shrivelling <i>Cailleach</i>, sharp bristled.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>It extends to three days, and its boisterous character is
shewn in the rhyme:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Feadag, Feadag, mother of the cold Faoilleach,</div>
<div class="verse">It kills sheep and lambs,</div>
<div class="verse">It kills the big kine one by one,</div>
<div class="verse">And horses at the same time.”<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<h3><i>Gobag</i>, THE SHARP-BILLED ONE,</h3>

<p class="noindent">lasts for a week, others say three, four, and nine days.</p>

<h3><i>Sguabag</i>, THE SWEEPER,</h3>

<p class="noindent">seems the same as the three days called “The Eddy
winds of the Storm Month” (<i>Ioma-sguaba na Faoilleach</i>).
The appearance of spring is now to be seen,
but the bad weather is not yet past. The worst
weather comes back occasionally, and there are fewer
gusts of wind, uncertain in their coming and duration,
that well deserve the name of “Eddy winds from
February.”</p>

<h3><i>Gearran</i>, A GELDING, OR PERHAPS <i>Gearan</i>, COMPLAINT.</h3>

<p>It is quite possible the latter may have been the
original name, as there is always associated with it a
period called <i>Caoile</i>, Leanness. It extends over a
month, and in Skye is made to succeed to the
<i>Faoilleach</i>. There was a rule known to old men, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
“the first Tuesday of March (O.S.) is the last Tuesday
of Gearran” (<i>a chiad Di-mairt de’n mhàrt an Di-mairt
mu dheire de ’n Ghearran</i>). In Tiree, from which the
lofty hills of Rum form a conspicuous sight, and to the
green appearance of which in frosty weather, their snow-covered
summits form a striking contrast, it is said, that
at the season “the big mare of Rum turns three times
to her colt,” <i>i.e.</i> from cold and hunger. The expression
refers to times when a little hardy breed of horses was
found in the Western Islands, like Shetland ponies, and
left to shift for themselves during winter. It was also
said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Then said Gearran to Faoilleach,</div>
<div class="verse">Where left you the poor stirk?</div>
<div class="verse">I left it with Him who made the elements,</div>
<div class="verse">Staring at a stack of fodder.</div>
<div class="verse">If I catch it, said the May month,</div>
<div class="verse">With the breath in the points of his ears,</div>
<div class="verse">I will send it racing to the hill</div>
<div class="verse">With its tail upon its shoulders.”<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The beast will pull through if it can “lift its ear higher
than its horn,” which at that age (one year), it ought to do.</p>

<p>The high winds coming at this time, and well known
in the south as the winds of March, were said in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
violence to “send seven bolls of driving snow through
one augur hole” (<i>Chuireadh an Gearran seachd bola catha,
stigh air aon toll tora, leis co gailbheach’s a bha ’n t-sìd</i>).</p>

<p>The Gearran is deemed the best time for sowing
seeds. The high winds dry the ground, and all agricultural
seeds are the better of being put in “a dry
bed” (<i>leaba thioram do’ n t-sìol</i>). It is a disputed point
what precise date.</p>

<p>The Perthshire rhyme also testifies to the still stormy
character of the weather. The calling the Gearran
short supports the opinion of many, that it was properly
only seven days:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Then, said the short Gearran,</div>
<div class="verse">I will play you a trick that is no better,</div>
<div class="verse">I will put the big cow in the mud,</div>
<div class="verse">Till the wave comes over its head.”<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Some say the Gearran is the month before St.
Patrick’s day O.S., others fourteen days before it and
fourteen days after, <i>i.e.</i> before and after 29th March.</p>

<h3><i>A Chailleach</i>, the old wife.</h3>

<p>This old wife is the same as the hag of whom people
were afraid in harvest, the last done with the shearing
had to feed her till next harvest, and to whom boys bid
defiance in their New-Year day rhyme, viz.: “The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Famine, or Scarcity of the Farm.” In spring she was
engaged with a hammer in keeping the grass under.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“She strikes here, she strikes there,</div>
<div class="verse">She strikes between her legs,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">but the grass grows too fast for her, and in despair she
throws the hammer from her, and where it lighted no
grass grows.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“She threw it beneath the hard, holly tree,</div>
<div class="verse">Where grass or hair has never grown.”<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<h3><i>Trì làithean nan ōisgean</i>, THREE HOG DAYS.</h3>

<p>In the rural lore of the south of Scotland, the three
hog days are held to be the last three days of March,
and to have been borrowed by that month from April
(Brand, ii. 42). Dr. Jamieson (<i>Etym. Dict. of Scot.
Lang.</i>) says, “Some of the vulgar imagine, that these
days receive their designation from the conduct of the
Israelites in borrowing the property of the Egyptians.”</p>

<p>There is a Highland explanation also connecting
them with the departure from Egypt. They were days
borrowed by the Israelites for the killing of the Paschal
lamb. “Some went on this side of the hillock, some on
that” (<i>Chàidh cuid an taobh so ’n Chnoc</i>, etc.).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>They are perhaps the days called in Tiree “<i>trì latha
na bo ruaidhe</i>” <i>i.e.</i> “the red cow’s three days.”</p>

<h3><i>Mhàrt</i>, SEED-TIME.</h3>

<p>This name is doubtlessly derived from the Latin
<i>Mars</i>, in which case it ought to correspond to the month
of March, O.S. It does not commence till the 24th of
that month. The word has come to signify a busy
time of the year, whether seed-time or harvest, usually,
however, the former. <i>Saothair a Mhàrt</i> is the “busiest
time of spring”; <i>a ghaoth luath luimeineach Mhàrt</i> means
“the bare swift March wind,” frequently mentioned in
<i>Winter Evening Tales</i> to denote great speed, and <i>a
Mhàrt tioram blath</i> means “dry genial March.” It is a
favourable sign of the season when the ground is saturated
with wet at its beginning. Old men wished,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The full pool awaiting March,</div>
<div class="verse">And house-thatch in the furrows of the plough land;”<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and deemed it a good sign if the violence of the wind
stripped three layers of thatch (<i>trì breathan de thugha</i>)
from the houses. The advice for sowing seed now is:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Let past the first March (<i>i.e.</i> Tuesday),</div>
<div class="verse">And second March if need be,</div>
<div class="verse">But be the weather good or bad,</div>
<div class="verse">Sow thy seed in the true March.”<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>Others say, “though you cannot send a pebble against
the north wind” (<i>ged nach cuireadh tu dòirneag an
aghaidh na gaoth tuath</i>) you are to sow.</p>

<p>“A night in March is swifter than two in harvest”
(<i>Is luaithe oidhche sa Mhàrt na dhà san fhogharadh</i>).</p>

<h3><i>Inid</i>, SHROVETIDE.</h3>

<p>The Gaelic name is from Lat. <i>Initium</i>, this being
the beginning of Lent. It was always reckoned as
“The first Tuesday of the Spring Light” (<i>chiad Di-màirt
de’n t-solus Earraich</i>), <i>i.e.</i> of the new moon in
spring. It is a moveable feast, and this is a simple way
of calculating it. The plan adopted by the English
Church is more complicated—Shrovetide is always the
seventh Tuesday before Easter, and Easter is “the
first Sunday after the first full moon, which happens
on or after the 21st March; but if the full moon is
on a Sunday, Easter day is the Sunday following.”</p>

<p>Shrovetide was called “<i>an Inid bheadaidh</i>” (shameless
Shrovetide), because the day of the festival was held
to precede the night, while, in the case of all the other
festivals, the night or vigil was held to precede the day.
A good reason for this will be found in a natural aversion
to begin the austerities of Lent.</p>

<p>It has been already told<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> (art. Diabolus) how Michael
Scott, or, according to Skye tradition, Parson Sir Andro
of Rigg, near Storr in that island, went to Rome, riding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
on the devil, and first ascertained from the Pope the rule
for calculating the day.</p>

<p>In schools it was the day for cock-fighting, and giving
gratuities to the schoolmaster. The latter custom was
observed with more correctness on the first Monday of
the year, being the day allotted for presents. The
practice of cock-fighting is extinct in the Highlands, but
presents to the schoolmaster are universally practised.
The boy and girl who give the largest donation (and it
seldom exceeds a shilling) are declared King and Queen
of the school, and have the privilege of asking “a play”
(<i>i.e.</i> a holiday) for the school.</p>

<p>The names connected with cock-fighting, still to be
found in the Highlands, being Latin, shew the practice
is not of native growth. Each boy came to the school
with a dunghill cock under his arm. The head of the
bird was covered and its tail taken out, to make it more
ready to fight, and fight better when let loose opposite
another bird.</p>

<p>Runaway cocks were called <i>fuge</i>, and the name is
still given to boys who shirk fighting. Shouts followed
the defeated bird of “run, run, cock with one eye”
(<i>fuge, fuge, coileach cam</i>), and its owner had to pay a
penalty of some pence.</p>

<p>Shrovetide was one of the great days for <i>saining</i>
cattle, juniper being burned before them, and other
superstitious precautions were taken to keep them free
from harm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>Those curious or anxious about their future husbands
or wives made a cake of soot (<i>Bonnach sùith, B. Inid</i>), of
which they partook, putting the rest below their pillows
to dream over.</p>

<p>It was believed that if there was fair weather at <i>Inid</i>
it would be foul weather at Easter, and <i>vice versâ</i>, as
the rhyme has it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Shrovetide said to Easter,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Where will I get a place to play myself?</div>
<div class="verse">Give to me a winter palace,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And I will build a summer house for you.”<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<h3><i>Carghas</i>, LENT,</h3>

<p class="noindent">is the period from Shrovetide to Easter. It extends
to 40 days, and refers to the miraculous fasts of
Moses, Elias, and our Lord. The Gaelic mode of
calculation was, “Seven short weeks from Shrovetide
till Easter” (<i>seachd seachdainean gearr goirid Eadar
Inid is Càisg</i>). The name <i>Carghas</i> is a corruption
<i>Quadragesima</i>, Ital. <i>Quaresimo</i>, 40, just as <i>Inid</i> is
from <i>Initium</i>. <i>Inid a charghuis</i> is just “the beginning
of the forty days.”<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<h3>ST. KESSOCK’S DAY (<i>Féill mo Cheasaig</i>)</h3>

<p class="noindent">was March 10/22. It is said, “On the Feast of St.
Kessock every eel is pregnant” (<i>Latha Feill mo Cheasaig
bithidh gach easgann torrach</i>).</p>

<p>The Saint was Bishop in Scotland in 560, and has
given a name to Kessock Ferry (<i>Port a Cheasaig</i>),
near Inverness, and to a market held at Callander,
Perthshire, for hiring, on the 22nd March, or 10th
old style. The fair is known as “Tenth-day,” but
among the Gaelic-speaking population as “<i>Féill mo
Cheasaig</i>.” A rock at the west end of the village is
known as “<i>Tom a Cheasaig</i>.”</p>

<h3>ST. PATRICK’S DAY (<i>Feill Pàruig</i>)</h3>

<p class="noindent">is the middle day of spring and that on which the
night and day are of equal length, March 17/29. A
certain sign of the day is held in the Hebrides to
be a south wind in the morning and a north wind
at night.</p>

<p>The saint comes from Ireland to see his parishioners
in Barra and other places on the west of Scotland, and
has a favourable wind coming and returning. He is in
Highland lore described as “Patrick who blessed Ireland”
(<i>Pàdruig a bheannaich Eirinn</i>), and is said to
have been married to the daughter of Ossian, bard,
and last, of the <i>Feinne</i>. He was born <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 373, but it
is disputed whether his native place was Scotland, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Wales, or England, or France. There can be no
question that in Ireland and the Highlands of Scotland
the more lively and kindly recollections of him
have been retained. Numerous places called after
him are found scattered over Scotland, Wales, and
Ireland.</p>

<p>After this day (<i>seach gun leum an Fhéill Pàruig</i>)
(lit. once Patrick’s Festival has jumped) the limpet is
better than the whelk, and is said in consequence to
treat it with great indignity.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>Latha Feill Pàruig</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Muinidh bhairneach air an fhaochaig.</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Another piece of shore information connected with
this season is that with the advance of spring “as
horses grow lean, crabs grow fat” (<i>mar is caoile ’n
t-each, ’s ann is reamhrad am partan</i>). Others have
it, “When the horse is lean, the whelk is fat” (<i>Nuair
bhios an t-each caol bi ’n fhaochag reamhar.</i>)</p>

<p>The reviving influences of the spring are now
making themselves visible, according to the saying,
“There is not an herb in the ground, but the length of
a mouse’s ear of it is out on St. Patrick’s Day”
(<i>Chaneil luibh san talamh, nach’ eil fad cluas luch dhi
mach, latha Féil Pàruig</i>).</p>

<p>Old men liked the days immediately preceding it to
be stormy, and to see, as they said, “the furrows full of
snow, of rain, and the thatch of houses” (<i>a chlaisich làn
sneachda, làn uisge, ’s tugha nan tighean</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>There are particularly high tides on St. Patrick’s
Day, and the annunciation of the Virgin Mary, according
to the saying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The spring tides of Lady Day</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Marbhladh na Feill Pàruig</i>, the deadening of St.
Patrick’s Day, means the quiet calm waters that
sometimes occur at this season; others say <i>Bogmharbhlainn</i>,
and say it means the swelling (<i>tòcadh</i>)
observable at the time in the sea (from the increasing
heat).</p>

<h3>LADY DAY (<i>Féill Moire</i>).</h3>

<p>This was known as <i>Féill Moire an t-sanais</i> (St.
Mary’s Vigil of annunciation) to distinguish it from
<i>Féill Moire Mòr</i> (the Big St. Mary’s-day), the assumption
of the Virgin, which was the middle day of
autumn. It is March 25/April 6.</p>

<h3>SHORE OR MAUNDY-THURSDAY.</h3>

<p>This was the Thursday before Easter, and was
known in the Hebrides as “<i>La Brochain Mhòir</i>,” the
Day of the Big Porridge. It was now getting late in
the spring, and if the winter had failed to cast a
sufficient supply of seaweed on the shores, it was
time to resort to extraordinary measures to secure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
the necessary manure for the land. A large pot of
porridge was prepared, with butter and other good
ingredients, and taken to the headlands near creeks
where seaweed rested. A quantity was poured into
the sea from each headland, with certain incantations
or rhymes, and in consequence, it was believed, the
harbours were full of sea-ware. The ceremony should
only be performed in stormy weather. Its object no
doubt was, by throwing the produce of the land into
the sea, to make the sea throw its produce on the
land.</p>

<h3>GOOD FRIDAY (<i>Di-haoine na Ceusa</i>).</h3>

<p>The Gaelic name means literally Crucifixion Friday.
The day was the Friday before Easter, and was
observed in memory of our Lord’s Passion. There
was hardly any belief that had a stronger hold on the
Highlander’s mind than that on no account whatever
should iron be put in the ground on this day. So
great was the aversion to doing so that the more
superstitious extended the prohibition to every Friday.
As a matter of course no ploughing was done, and if a
burial was to take place, the grave was opened on the
previous day, and the earth was settled over the coffin
with a wooden shovel. The origin of the observance
perhaps was that our Saviour’s sepulchre had been
previously prepared, being a new tomb hewn out in the
rock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>It was said that if the day be cold, it is colder than
any other, in fact the coldest day of the whole year.</p>

<h3>EASTER (<i>Càsg</i>).</h3>

<p>The proper day for keeping this festival, the anniversary
of our Lord’s resurrection, was at one time the
cause of bitter controversies in the Christian world. It
was first a subject of keen dispute between the Eastern
and Western Churches, and again between the Church
of Rome and the Irish and British Churches. The
feast is moveable, and depends on the time of the first
full moon after the vernal equinox. Owing to rectifications
of the calendar introduced at Rome, but unknown
to the British Churches, two different days had come
to be observed, and by the seventh century the discussion
as to which day was the correct one had
become so warm and the difference so scandalous that
the civil powers interfered and the question was settled
in favour of the Church of Rome by Oswy, King of
Northumbria, at Whitby in 664. The Celtic clergy
were accused of being Quartodecimans (a very good
word in a controversy), that is, of keeping the festival,
according to the Jewish mode of calculation, on the
fourteenth day of the month Nizan, whether that day
fell on a Sunday or not. The accusation is now universally
acknowledged to be ill-founded, but it is likely
they followed the Alexandrian rule on the point, by
which the Easter festival could not begin till the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
eighth of March, a rule which had been at one time
observed by the Church of Rome itself. Neither the
cycle followed during the controversy by the Celtic
Church, nor that followed by the Romish Church, is that
now prevailing, so that if one day was of more value than
another for the festival, both parties were in the wrong.</p>

<p>The rule now observed in the Highlands is “seven
short weeks from Shrovetide to Easter,” Shrovetide
being “the first Tuesday of the New Moon in Spring,”
or, Easter is “the first Sunday of the second wane of
the moon in spring” (<i>chiad Di-dòmhnaich de ’n dara
earra-dhubh san Earrach</i>).</p>

<p>The name “<i>Càsg</i>” is but the Gaelic form of the
Hebrew <i>Pascha</i>. The change of P into C, K, or Q is
well known in philology, and the most noticeable
difference between the Welsh and Gaelic branches of
the Celtic tongue is, that the latter has an aversion
which the former has not to <i>p</i> as an initial consonant,
preferring <i>c</i> instead. Lhuyd (<i>Arch. Brit.</i>, p. 20) says, “It
is very remarkable that there are scarce any words in
the Irish (besides what are borrowed from the Latin or
some other language) that begin with P, insomuch that
in an ancient alphabetical vocabulary I have by me,
that letter is omitted; and no less observable that a
considerable number of those words whose initial letter
it is in the British begin in that language with a K or
(as they constantly write) C.” He then quotes as
illustrations, W. <i>Pask</i>, Easter, Ir. <i>Kasg</i>; Corn. <i>Peneas</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
Whitsuntide, Ir. <i>Kinkis</i>; W. <i>pen</i>, a head, Ir. <i>keann</i>, etc.
He quotes from Vassius instances of a similar change
in the interrogatives and relatives of the Greek Ionic
dialect. A readily recognised instance is the change
of the Greek ἱππος into the Latin <i>equus</i>.</p>

<p>On Càisg Sunday, the sun was believed in the Highlands
of Scotland, as in Ireland, to dance soon after
rising, and many respectable people are to be found
who say they saw the phenomenon. The alternate
glancing and darkening of the sun on a fitful spring
morning was no doubt often so construed by those who
stared too long at a brilliant object.</p>

<p>A liability to north wind has made “<i>Gaoth tuath na
Càisg</i>” (the north wind of Easter) a proverbial expression.
The most trying part of the spring is still to
come, and it is an expression employed to moderate
excessive joy, and to put people in mind that the cares
of life are not all past yet, that there is “a long spring
after Easter” (<i>Earrach fada ’n déigh Càisg</i>).</p>

<p>Another expression, reminding men that it is not
too late to acquit themselves of their duties or hold
rejoicings, is “a Feast can be kept after Easter”
(<i>Gleidhear cuirm an déigh Càisg</i>).</p>

<p>Easter was a particular holiday with the young, and
preparations were made for it long beforehand. Every
egg that a boy could steal or lay his hands on unobserved,
was hid by him in the thatch of an out-house,
or in a hole in the ground, under a turf, or wherever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
else he thought his treasure would remain undiscovered.
When the great day came, he and his companions, each
with his collection of eggs, went away to some retired
spot, at a distance from the houses, and beyond the
probability of being disturbed by their seniors. Here
they had a grand feast of pancakes, and enjoyed themselves
uncontrolled. The eggs were deemed of no use
unless they had been secreted or stolen, and this
originated, perhaps, in a feeling that with honestly or
openly got eggs the feast was not so entirely
independent of the older people.</p>

<p>The reason why eggs were used at all is supposed to
be from an egg being emblematic of the resurrection.</p>

<p>Two Sundays were held as Càisg. The second was
distinguished only by a better feast than usual in the
houses. The first Sunday was called “Big Easter”
(<i>Càisg mhòr</i>), and the Sunday after it “Old Men’s
Easter” (<i>Càisg nam bodach</i>), corresponding to the
English Low Sunday.</p>

<h3>ALL-FOOLS’ DAY</h3>

<p class="noindent">is variously known in the Highlands as “The Day of
going on Fools’ errands” (<i>Latha na Gogaireachd</i>),
“Cuckoo Day” (<i>Latha na Cuthaig</i>), and “The Day of
Tricks” (<i>Latha nan Car</i>). Its observance is on the
first of April, N.S., and this argues its very recent
introduction into the Highlands. The tricks and practices
of the day are the same as elsewhere, the sending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
of acquaintances on sleeveless errands. Sometimes, but
only rarely, there is some ingenuity displayed in taking
advantage of local and passing events to throw the
most suspicious off their guard, and send them on fools’
messages. It is not difficult to impose on men with a
serious face and a plausible story, when it entails but
little trouble to see if so likely a story or so pressing a
message is real.</p>

<h3><i>Bailc na Bealltainn</i>.</h3>

<p>The fourteen days preceding May-day were known
as <i>Bailc na Bealltainn</i>, “the balk or ridge of Beltane.”
The sea is then as it were awakening, and is more
obedient to the winds. <i>Balc</i> means a ridge, also swelling,
strength, <i>onfhadh</i>, <i>foghail</i>. The weather threatens
frequently without breaking.</p>

<h3><i>Bealltainn</i>, MAY-DAY.</h3>

<p>The advent of summer is everywhere hailed with
joy, and the day recognised as the first of the season is
naturally one of the most important days in the calendar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
Another day of equal importance in the Celtic
year was the first of winter, and the names of the two
days, <i>Bealltainn</i> and <i>Samhainn</i>, cannot be traced, like
so many other notations of the year, to ecclesiastical
sources. Like the names <i>Faoilleach</i> (the Storm month),
and <i>Iuchar</i> (the Hot month), they are best referred to
Pagan times.</p>

<p><i>Bealltainn</i> is commonly derived from <i>Bel teine</i>, the
fire of Baal or Belus, and is considered as sure evidence
of the Phoenician origin of the sacred institutions of the
Celts. It is a derivation, however, that wants all the
elements of probability. There is a want of evidence
that the Phoenician Baal, or any deity resembling him,
was ever worshipped by the Celts, or that the fires
kindled and observances practised on this day had any
connection with the attributes ascribed to him; while
the analogies of the Gaelic language prevent the supposition
that “the fire of Baal” could be rendered
“Beall-tein’.” Besides, the word is not <i>Beall-teine</i>, but
<i>Bealltainn</i>, a difference in the final syllable sufficiently
noticeable to a Gaelic ear. It is the difference between
the single and double sound of <i>n</i>. Baal and Ashtoreth
were the supreme male and female divinities of the
Phoenician and Canaanitish nations, and are supposed
to be personifications of the generative and receptive
powers of nature, and to be identical with the sun and
moon. In Hebrew and kindred languages, <i>Baal</i> is a
mere title of honour, signifying “Lord or Possessor of,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
and in Gaelic the Sun and Moon are both feminine
nouns, merely descriptive of the appearance of these
planets. There is nothing that indicates their ever
having been looked on as divinities, or ascribing to
them any attribute such as belonged to Baal. In Gaelic
the noun limited or possessed always precedes the
qualifying noun, and it would require strong evidence
to show that “Baal’s fire” could be “Beltane” <i>i.e.</i> Baal-fire,
and not “Tane-Bel” (<i>Teine-Bhàil</i>), <i>i.e.</i> fire of
Baal. The contrast between English and Gaelic in this
respect is often very striking, and a safe rule in
etymology!</p>

<p>The final syllable is the same as in <i>Samhainn</i>, the end
of summer, which is thought by Lhuyd, to be from
<i>fuinn</i> (connected with the Latin <i>finis</i>), an end. In this
case <i>t</i> is simply accresive. <i>L</i> has an attraction for <i>t</i>
after it, as <i>m</i> has for <i>b</i>, and <i>n</i> for <i>d</i>. <i>Beall</i> is likely
connected with the other words that have <i>bl</i> in their
initial syllable, with a root idea of separating, parting,
opening; and claims kindred with <i>blàth</i>, a blossom,
<i>bial</i>, the mouth, <i>bealach</i>, a pass, more than with the title
of a Semitic deity. It is the opening day of the year,
when the rigours of winter are parted with, and the
seasons, as it were, separate. Behind lay winter, cold,
and unfruitfulness of the earth, but before was warmth
and fertility and beauty. The final syllable has no
more to do with fire than it has in <i>gamhainn</i>, a stirk,
<i>calltainn</i>, a hazel tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>It was said, with truth, that whatever day New Year
day fell upon, Beltane fell on the day following. “New
Year’s day to-day, Beltane to-morrow” (<i>Nollaig an
diugh, Bealltainn a màireach</i>).</p>

<p>There is sometimes very cold weather at this time,
and this was denoted by the expression “The mournful
linnet of Beltane” (<i>Glaisein cumhach na Bealltainn</i>).
Snow at the time was known as “Snow about the mouth
of May-day” (<i>Sneachda mu bhial na Bealltainn</i>).</p>

<p>On the night preceding it, <i>i.e.</i> Beltane eve, witches
were awake, and went about as hares, to take their produce
(<i>toradh</i>), milk, butter, and cheese, from the cows.
People who believed in their existence were as earnest
to counteract their machinations. Tar was put behind
the ears of the cattle, and at the root of the tail; the
animals were sprinkled with urine to keep them from
fighting; the house was hung with rowan-tree, etc.,
etc. By having a churning past and a cheese made
(<i>muidhe ’s mulchag</i>) before sunrise, the Fairies were kept
away from the farm for the rest of the year. If any
came to ask for rennet (<i>deasgainn</i>), it should not on any
account be given to them. It would be used for taking
the substance out of the giver’s own dairy produce.</p>

<p>When the day arrived, it was necessary, whatever
the state of the weather, though people sank ankle deep
in snow, or (as the Gaelic idiom has it), though snow
came over the shoes, to get the cattle away to the
summer pastures among the hills (<i>àiridh</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>No fire on this, or any other first day of a quarter
of the year (<i>latha ceann raidhe</i>), was given out of the
house. It gave the borrower the power of taking the
milk from the lender’s cows.</p>

<p>People had a feast in their houses with better food
than ordinary. The arrival of the cuckoo was looked
for, and boys shouted “Cuckoo! cried the ‘gowk’ on
yellow Beltane day” (<i>Gug-ùg ars’ a Chuthag latha
buidhe Bealltainn</i>).</p>

<p>In the Statistical Account of Scotland, 1794, XI.
620, there is a custom described, as existing at Callander
in Perthshire, of boys going on this day to the moors,
and kneading a cake of oatmeal, one part of which was
daubed black. The bread was then put in a bonnet,
from which each drew a piece. The boy, to whose
share the black piece falls, is obliged to leap three
times through the flames, at which the repast was prepared.
The minister of Logierait (V. 84), says the
festivities of the day were chiefly observed by herdsmen,
and Pennant (<i>Tour</i>, p. 90), describes a similar
feast of herdsmen, in which pieces of the cake were
offered to the fox, hoodie-crow, eagle, etc., with a
request that they would avoid the cattle during the
year. In the south of Ireland, we are told (<i>vide</i> Brand
on May-day customs), cows were made to leap over
lighted straw. All this has been referred to Baal and
human sacrifices, and the going through the fire and
other observances, have been assumed to be the remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
of Syrian rites. They seem to be nothing but parts of
the numerous superstitious observances for the <i>saining</i>
of cattle.</p>

<p>A <i>Sop seilbhe</i>, or “Possession Wisp,” was burned on
land, of which possession was to be taken at Whitsunday.
The wisp was of fodder or heather. The burning
of it on the land, as already explained, insured
possession (<i>bha e ceangailte aige tuille</i>).</p>

<h3><i>Céitein</i>, MONTH OF MAY.</h3>

<p>This is the month of which Beltane day, O.S., forms
the centre, and consists of the last fourteen days of
spring, and the first fourteen days of summer. Its
derivation is from <i>ceud</i>, first, it being the beginning of
the summer season. It is identical with the present
month of May. “Better is snow in May, than to be
without rain” (<i>’S fhearr sneachda sa Céitein na bhi gun
uisge</i>).</p>

<p>The month preceding Beltane was called <i>Céitein na
h-òinsich</i>, “the May-days of the silly one,” the word
<i>òinseach</i> denoting both a silly woman and a cuckoo.
The habits of the bird, which has no nest of its own,
and goes about all day aimlessly uttering its peculiar
note, has earned for it the reputation of being silly, as
is witnessed also by the Scotch word <i>gowk</i>, and premature
glimpses of fine weather are supposed to mislead it
as to the advent of May.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<h3>WHISTLING WEEK.</h3>

<p><i>Seachdain na feadaireachd</i>, the whistling week, is the
first week of summer, and the name is in allusion to the
loud, whistling winds, that are apt to occur at the time.
It is unlucky during it to proceed with field operations.</p>

<h3><i>Màigh</i>, MAY.</h3>

<p>The name <i>Màigh</i>, for the first month of summer, is
quite common in the Highlands, and is to be found in
songs and proverbs. This is mentioned as shewing
incontestably that Roman (or rather ecclesiastical)
notations of time were adopted into the ancient Celtic
calendar.</p>

<h3>THE AVOIDING DAY OF THE YEAR.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Latha seachnach na Bliadhna.</i>)</p>

<p>This is the third day of summer, and its name is
almost the only part of the beliefs concerning it, that
now survives. The writer searched far and wide for an
explanation of the name, and only once heard one that
was satisfactory. It was on this day that the fallen
angels were expelled from Paradise, and on it people
should avoid doing any kind of evil. If caught in the
act, they will be similarly expelled from the regions of
forgiveness, and be visited with “judgement without
mercy.” If it falls on a Friday, it is unlucky to go on
a journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>Pennant says about it, “The fourteenth May is
unlucky, and the day on which it falls.”</p>

<h3><i>Caingis</i>, WHITSUNTIDE, PENTECOST.</h3>

<p>This and Martinmas are the two principal term
days in Scotland, at which half-yearly servants enter
on their duties, and at which removals take place.
At Whitsunday term (old style) especially, the 25th
of May, the towns of Scotland present an animated
appearance from the number of removals, or changes
of residences. The streets are crowded with household
goods being removed from one house to another.
Tenants at will are removed and leases expire at this
term.</p>

<p>In Lorn, and the districts to the south of it, along
by Lochfyneside, the term is called <i>Feill Breunain</i>.
St. Brendan the Elder, from whom the name is derived,
was abbot of Clonfest in Ireland <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 578. His day is
May 16-28. Kilbrandon parish (in Gaelic <i>Sgìreachd
a Chuain</i>, the parish of the ocean) in the west of
Argyllshire, derives its name from him, and there is
a farm in the island of Mull of the same name.
History records that the saint with 14 companions
once made a voyage in search of Paradise, and in
stormy weather, when the sea is rough and the sky
inclement, and the earth is hid with driving showers
[it excites a smile], that he came north in the hope of
finding it. There are days indeed in summer in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
Hebrides, when a glory covers the sea and sky and the
hills “that encircle the sea,” when he might think that
he was on the way.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>In Sutherlandshire, people reckon by the <i>Feill Chelzie</i>,
a market held on Tuesday of the term, deriving its
name from a wool manufactory, now discontinued,
called <i>New Kelso</i>, near Loch Carron.</p>

<p>The names <i>Caingis</i>, Whitsuntide, and Pentecost, are
modifications of one and the same word. Pentecost
became <i>pencas</i> in Cornish, in Gaelic (which represents
<i>p</i> of the Welsh dialects by <i>c</i>) <i>caingis</i> (Kinkis), as <i>pascha</i>
became W. <i>pâsk</i>, Gael. <i>Càisg</i> (Kasg). The Gaelic
<i>c</i> or <i>k</i> sound is represented in the Saxon tongue by <i>wh</i>.
Thus we have <i>cuibhle</i> (cuile), wheel; <i>cuip</i>, whip; <i>ciod</i>,
what?; <i>cuilein</i>, whelp; <i>co</i>, who?; <i>cuist</i>, wheesht! be
quiet!; <i>caoin</i>, whine; etc. So <i>cencas</i> has become
<i>Whitsun</i>. The feast has no name in the languages of
Western Europe, but such as are derivations of the
Greek word. The English name has been thought to
be an exception, and to be, therefore, of modern origin.
From the light thrown upon it by the Celtic languages,
we infer that it is of the same origin as the rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Caingis</i> is reckoned to be “at the end of a fortnight
of summer.”</p>

<h3><i>Feill-Sheathain</i>, ST. JOHN’S OR MID-SUMMER’S EVE,
24TH JUNE-6TH JULY.</h3>

<p>On this day, the cuckoo was said to enter its winter
house (<i>theid a chuthag na tigh geamhraidh</i>). It is not
natural for its song to be heard after this. The bird
may be seen, but it is not heard. It is, like the landrail,
stonechat, or other birds that disappear in winter,
one of the seven sleepers, who were believed to pass
the winter underground.</p>

<p><i>Seathan</i>, Swithin, is the old form of the name John,
the common form being <i>Iain</i>, <i>Eòin</i>, and in Islay <i>Eathin</i>.
It still survives in the name of the Clan Maclean,
Mac-ill’-sheathain, also written MacGhilleòin. A former
minister of Kilmore in Mull is still remembered as
<i>Maighsthir Seathain</i>, and an exceedingly plaintive
song, composed to her husband, who had been betrayed
and executed for piracy, by his widow, begins “Swithin
is to-night a dead one.”</p>

<h3><i>Mios crochadh nan Con</i>, DOG-DAYS.</h3>

<p class="center">(Lit. month for hanging dogs.)</p>

<p>This is but a boyish and sportive name given to
the month preceding <i>Lùnasdal</i>, or first of August,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
the time of greatest scarcity with the poor. The
stores of last harvest are exhausted, and the new
supplies are not yet come in. If there is a scarcity
of food for the dogs, it is recommended as the best
thing that can be done, to hang them. Besides, the
excessive heat makes it advisable to get rid of all
superfluous dogs.</p>

<h3><i>Latha Martainn Builg</i>, TRANSLATION OF MARTIN.</h3>

<p class="center">(Lit. Martin of the Bag’s Day.)</p>

<p>July 4-16 received its title of the Translation of
Martin from being the day on which the remains of
St. Martin, Bishop of Tours, 397, “the apostle of the
Gauls” (who also gives his name to the Martinmas
term) were transferred to the Cathedral of Tours. In
Scotland the day is called St. Martin of Bullions Day,
and it was a proverb that if the deer rise dry and
lie down dry on it, that is if the morning and evening
be dry, it will be a dry season till harvest; and it
was a general belief over Europe that rain on this
day betokened wet weather for the next twenty days.</p>

<p>The Day of St. Martin of the Bag is commonly
translated St. Swithin’s day, which is the 15th. St.
Swithin was Bishop of Winchester, and no name of
an English Bishop is found in the Gaelic calendar.</p>

<h3><i>Lùnasdal</i>, LAMMAS, AUGUST 1-12TH.</h3>

<p>This, being a quarter day, formed a great day with
old women for saining cattle, and performing those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
ceremonies by which evil was to be kept away from
them for the next three months. Tar was put on their
tails and ears, charms (<i>òradh</i>) were said at their udders,
red and blue threads were put on their tails, and various
observances were gone through with balls of hair
(<i>rolag</i>), plants, fire about the earthenware pipkins
(<i>crogain</i>) in which milk or butter was to be put, etc.
Curds and butter were specially prepared for a great
feast held this day, at which it was highly important
that everyone got as much as he cared for.</p>

<p>On Lammas day, the gad-fly “loses one of its eyes”
(<i>Latha Lùnasdal caillidh chreithleag an leth shùil</i>). The
creature is not so vicious after this date.</p>

<p><i>Lùnasdal</i> is not a word of Gaelic origin, at least no
satisfactory Gaelic etymology can be given for it. It
is perhaps a contraction of the Latin, <i>luna augustalis</i>,
the August moon. The Roman month was lunar, and
was reckoned from the first appearance of the moon’s
slender crescent in the sky. The moon in the harvest
months is of more consequence to the husbandman
than at any other season, and has always been taken
notice of for its splendour. The temperature of the
night air has much to do with this. The Gaelic bears
its own testimony to it, in giving distinctive names to
the autumn moon.</p>

<p>The corresponding English name, Lammas, had very
likely the same origin, and it is a contraction of <i>Lunamas</i>.
The derivation of it from Lamb-mas is an “affectation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
of punning,” and that suggested by Gen. Vallancey from
La-ith-mas, “a day of eating fruit,” is extremely fanciful.
The omission of <i>n</i> in the middle of a word, for
the sake of brevity or from inadvertence, frequently
occurs. So <i>g</i> has been elided in <i>Lùnasdal</i>. Augustus,
which was adopted as the name of the sixth month
<span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> 6, became <i>east</i> in Cornish and <i>eost</i> in Armoric.</p>

<h3><i>Iuchar</i>, THE HOT MONTH (<i>i.e.</i> AUGUST).</h3>

<p>The <i>Iuchar</i> consists of 14 days of summer and 14
days of autumn, and Lammas Day, O.S., being the first
of autumn, corresponds to the present month of August.
It is regarded, in point of weather, as the opposite of
<i>Faoilleach</i>, the “storm month” of February.</p>

<p>The name is derived from an obsolete verb <i>fiuchadh</i>
to be hot. Lhuyd (<i>Archæolog. Brit.</i>) renders <i>fiuchaeh</i>,
boiling, and <i>fiuchadh</i>, a spring, <i>scatebra</i>. In another
place he gives <i>fiuchadh</i> as an equivalent of the Latin
<i>æstus</i>. In some districts of the north, the name of the
season is still called <i>Fiuchar</i>. Linlithgow, celebrated
for its wells, is known in the Highlands as <i>Gleann Iuch</i>,
and the Linlithgow measures are called <i>tomhaís Ghlinn
Iuch</i>. The dropping of <i>f</i> initial, as in the case of
the Greek digamma, is too common to need illustration.</p>

<h3><i>Fèill Moire</i>, ASSUMPTION DAY.</h3>

<p>This is the middle day of autumn (<i>latha meadhon an
fhogharaidh</i>), August 15-27. It was counted a greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
day than St. Mary’s Day (<i>Féill Moire</i>) in spring, and
was called “the Big St. Mary’s Day.” Harvest operations
were now vigorously pushed forward, and hence
the saying, “Big St Mary’s Feast in harvest, sheaf and
binding and men with their coats off” (<i>an Fhéill Mhoire
mòr a’s t-fhogharadh sguab ’us ceangal ’s daoin’ as an
léintean</i>).</p>

<h3><i>Féill Ròid</i>, ROODMAS, SEPTEMBER 14-26.</h3>

<p>This day is the first of the rutting season among
deer, and it was held that if the night before it (<i>oidhche
na Féill Ròid</i>), be wet, or (as it was expressed), “if the
deer took his head wet into the rutting season” (<i>ma
bheir e cheann fliuch san dàmhair</i>), there will be a month
after it of dry weather, and the farmer need be under
no apprehension as to securing his crops. The belling
of red deer among the hills on this night is magnificent.</p>

<p>The night succeeding Roodmas was called “the
night of the nut,” “the night of the Holy Nut” (<i>oidhche
na cnò, na cnò Naomh</i>), a name, the reason of which
is doubtful. Some say it arises from this night
dividing harvest in unequal halves, as the kernel is
divided in the nut. Brand (i. 353) mentions a custom
of going a nutting upon Rood Day, and it seems to
have been a popular belief that on this day the devil
goes a nutting. This does not explain why the nut is
called the Holy Nut.</p>

<p>The Holy Rood is the same as the Cross.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<h3>MICHAELMAS (<i>Feill Mìcheil</i>)</h3>

<p class="noindent">is also known in the Roman Catholic districts of the
Highlands, as “the Riding Day” (<i>latha na marcachd</i>).
On the level green of Borg (<i>machaire Bhorg</i>), in Barra,
a great race is held, the women bringing the horses, and
sitting behind the men on horseback. In the scamper
that ensues, it is a lucky sign if the woman tumbles off.
All the expenses of the festivity are borne by the women,
each of whom takes with her to the racecourse a large
thick bannock of oatmeal, made with treacle, butter, etc.</p>

<h3><i>Samhain</i>, HALLOWMAS,</h3>

<p class="noindent">is the first day of winter, and is also known as All-Saints’
Day (<i>Latha nan uile Naomh</i>), Nov. 1-13. It
was a sign of a bad winter if it fell upon a Wednesday,
according to the saying: “When Hallowmas is on
Wednesday, it is afflictive after it” (<i>Nuair is Di-ciadaìn
an t-samhainn is iargaineach na déigh</i>).</p>

<p>The coming of winter was hailed with more fun and
merriment than any other season of the year. The
cold was now fairly set in, the fruits of the summer,
down to the very nuts, were gathered, and the young
became desirous of learning their fate with regard to
that subject of anxiety in every age, their future husbands
and wives. This natural welcoming of winter
explains the ceremonies of the day, and the games of
the evening. Hardly any of them have reference to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
the practices or deities of the nations of antiquity or to
Scripture, and this explanation must be sought for in
Pagan times.</p>

<p>On the last day of autumn children gathered ferns,
tar-barrels, the long thin stalks called <i>gàinisg</i>, and everything
suitable for a bonfire. These were placed in a
heap on some eminence near the house, and in the
evening set fire to. The fires were called <i>Samhnagan</i>.
There was one for each house, and it was an object of
ambition who should have the biggest. Whole districts
were brilliant with bonfires, and their glare across a
Highland loch, and from many eminences, formed an
exceedingly picturesque scene. Some find in them
traces of the worship of the invariable Baal, but there is
no reason to look upon them otherwise than as the
natural and defiant welcome of the season, in which
fires are most required, when the heat of the year is
departed, and cold and frost and rushing winds cover
all things with gloom. Bonfires are kindled on all
occasions of public rejoicing, or excitement, and Hallowmas
fires are a natural expression of the change of
season. It is possible a deity was originally associated
with the practice, but there is now no trace of him in
name or practices of this day.</p>

<p>As the evening wore on, the young people gathered
to one house, and an almost endless variety of games
(<i>cleasan</i>) were resorted to, with the object in every case
of divining the future lot of the company. Were they to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
marry or not, was it to be that year or never, who was
to be married first, what like the future husband or wife
was to be, their names, trade, colour of hair, size,
property, etc.? were questions of great importance, and
their answer was a source of never-failing entertainment.
The modes of divination are of interest, from
the light they throw on the character of the people
among whom they prevailed, and from an antiquarian
point of view, as remains of Pagan times.</p>

<p>A shoe caught by the tip and thrown over the house,
fore-indicates the future by its position on the ground
on the other side. In whatever direction the toe
points, the thrower will go before long, and it is very
unlucky if the shoe be found with the sole uppermost,
misfortune is “making for” him. A thin, fine shoe,
used in this manner, led the man, fished up from the
Green Island, to remark, after some years of silence:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“A thin shoe, little valued,</div>
<div class="verse">It is hard to say who will wear it.”<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He might well say so, for the owner of the shoe died
in a few days.</p>

<p>The white of eggs, dropped in a glass of pure water,
indicates by certain marks how many children a person
is to have. The impatience and clamour of the children
often made the housewife perform this ceremony
for them by daylight, and the kindly mother, standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
with her face to the window, dropping the white of an
egg into a crystal glass of clean water, and surrounded
by a group of children, eagerly watching her proceedings,
formed a pretty picture.</p>

<p>When the fun of the evening had fairly commenced,
the names of eligible, or likely as possible matches,
were written on the chimney place, and the young man,
who wished to essay his fortune, was blindfolded and
led up to the list. Whatever name he put his finger
on would prove to be that of his future wife.</p>

<p>Two nuts were put on the fire beside each other,
representing two individuals, whose names were made
known to the company. As they burned together, or
flared up alone, or leaped away from each other, the
future marriage of the pair, or haughty rejection of each
other, was inferred.</p>

<p>A dish of milk and meal (<i>fuarag</i>, Scot. crowdie), or
of beat potatoes, was made, and a ring was concealed
in it. Spoons were given to the company, and a
vigorous attack was made on the dish. Whoever
got the ring would prove to be the first married. This
was an excellent way of making the taking of food part
of the evening’s merriment.</p>

<p>Apples and a silver sixpence were put in a tub of
water. The apples floated on the top, but the coin lay
close to the bottom. Whoever was able to lift either
in his mouth, and without using his teeth, was counted
very lucky, and got the prize to himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>By taking an apple and going to a room alone,
dividing it there into nine pieces against the name of
the Father and the Son, eating eight pieces with the
back to a looking glass and the face looking over the
left shoulder, and then throwing the ninth piece over
the same shoulder, the future husband or wife was seen
in the glass coming and taking the piece of apple
away.</p>

<p>A person, going in the devil’s name to winnow in a
barn alone, will see his future partner entering the
door.</p>

<p>An unmarried woman, taking a ball of thread and
crossing a wall on her way, went to a kiln or other
out-house. Here, holding one end of the thread, she
threw the ball in the dark into the eye of the kiln
(<i>sùil àth</i>), or over one of the rafters or a partition wall,
in the name of a sweetheart whom she had before fixed
on in her mind, and calling out “who is down there at
the end of my little rope?” (<i>co so shìos air ceann mo
ròpain?</i>), at the same time she gave the thread a gentle
pull. In reply, some one or something pulled the
thread at the other end, and a voice called out the
name of her future husband. There is a story of a
tailor having hid himself in anticipation of this mode of
divination being resorted to, and when the ball was
thrown he caught it and gave the thread a tug. In
answer to the question “who is this at the end of my
little rope?” he said, “I am the devil” (<i>Tha mise, ’n<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
deamhan</i>), and the woman to whom this frightful
answer was given never tried divination again.</p>

<p>Young women sowed hemp seed (<i>fras lìn</i>) over nine
ridges of plough land, saying “I sow hemp seed, and he
who is to be my husband, let him come and harrow it”
(<i>Tha mi cur fras lìn, ’s am fear bhios na fhear ’dhomh,
thigeadh e ’s cliathadh e</i>). On looking back they saw
the figure of their future husband. Hallowe’en being
the night preceding the first day of a lunar month was
always dark, and this ceremony was rendered more
awful by a story that a woman once saw herself coming
after her, and never recovered from the effects of
the vision.</p>

<p>By dipping his shirt sleeve in a well to the south
(<i>tobar mu dheas</i>), and then pulling off the shirt and
placing it to dry before the fire, the anxious youth, if
he does not oversleep himself, will see his sweetheart
entering through the night and turning the shirt.</p>

<p>On putting an odd number of keys in a sieve, going
to a barn alone, and there riddling them well “with the
wrong hand turn” (<i>car tuaitheal</i>), the destined one will
come and put the odd key right.</p>

<p>By holding a mouthful of water in the mouth, and
going to listen (<i>farcluais</i>) at a neighbour’s window, the
first name overheard will prove to be that of one’s
intended.</p>

<p>The same knowledge was obtained by biting a piece
of the last cart that sent in the corn, and with it in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
mouth going, without speaking, to listen (<i>farcluais</i>)
under a neighbour’s window.</p>

<p>A common practice was to go and steal kail stocks.
Unless the plants are pulled surreptitiously, without the
knowledge or consent of their owner, they are of no
use for the purpose of divination. A number of young
people go together, and having cautiously and with
difficulty made their way into a kailyard, pull each one
the first stock that comes to hand after bending down.
It must be the first that the hand meets. The plant is
then taken home and examined by the light, and
according to its height, straightness, colour, etc., will be
the future husband or wife. A quantity of soil adhering
to it signifies money and property. When put for the
night above the lintel of the door, it affords indications
by the first person entering below it in the morning;
and, put below the pillow, it is excellent to dream over.</p>

<p>A straw, drawn at random from a stack, indicates by
the number of grains upon it what family a person is
to have.</p>

<p>Three ears of corn similarly pulled and placed below
the pillow for the night, will cause dreams of the future
husband reaping them.</p>

<p>A plate of clean water, one of dirty water, and one
empty being placed on the floor, and a napkin thrown
over the eyes, the dish in which the person blindfolded
puts his forefinger, indicated a maid, or widow, or
none at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>A piece of flesh being buried this night, if any living
creature was found in it in the morning, the person
burying it would be married; but if not, he never would.</p>

<p>If water, in which the feet had been washed, were
kept in the house this night,<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> (and the Fairies were apt
to enter the house when that was the case), a person
putting a burning peat in it will see the colour of his
sweetheart’s hair in it.</p>

<p>If a mouthful of the top sod of the house wall (<i>fòid
fàil na h-anainn</i>), or a mouthful from the clod above
the lintel of the door (<i>àrd-dorus</i>) be taken into the
house in one’s teeth and any hair be found in it, it is
of the same colour as that of the future wife of the
person who performs the rite.</p>

<p>One of the chief performances of the evening was for
young women to go to a Boundary Stream (<i>allt crìche</i>),
(if between two neighbouring proprietors so much the
better,) and with closed eyes to lift from it three stones
between the middle finger and thumb, saying these
words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I will lift the stone</div>
<div class="verse">As Mary lifted it for her Son,</div>
<div class="verse">For substance, virtue, and strength;</div>
<div class="verse">May this stone be in my hand</div>
<div class="verse">Till I reach my journey’s end.”<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>The stones were for putting below the head when going
to sleep.</p>

<p>Many other modes of divination were practised too
tedious to mention, by slices from the plough, different
metals, eating a stolen raw salt herring, sprinkling corn
in front of the bed, etc., etc. These observances can
hardly be characterised as superstitions; they proceeded
from a spirit of fun more than from any belief in their
efficacy. There are in every community many weak
and simple people who are easily imposed on, and made
to believe almost anything; but the divinations of Hallowe’en
left an abiding impression on few minds.</p>

<h3><i>Feill Fionnain.</i></h3>

<p>St. Finan’s Eve is the longest night in the year, and
hence it is said of a very stupid person, “he is as dark
as the night of St. Finan, and that night is pretty dark”
(<i>Tha e co dorcha ri oidhche Feill Fionnain, ’s tha ’n
oidhche sin glè dhorcha</i>). The shortest day is called, in
the Mackay country, the extreme north of Sutherlandshire,
“The Day of the Three Suppers” (<i>Latha nan trì
suipeirean</i>).</p>

<p>On this night it was said “the rain is wine and the
stones are cheese” (<i>Tha ’n t-uisge na fhìon ’s na clachan
nan càise</i>), and it was considered a joke to persuade
boys to go out and see. “I remember,” says one who
is a shrewd intelligent man, “about fifty years ago,
when I was a little boy, sitting quite contentedly on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
the Eve of St. Finan’s Day sipping with a spoon from
a big tub of water, in the full hope that the next spoonful
would prove to be wine.”</p>

<p>The name is derived from St. Finan, confessor, Bp.
of Clonard, in Ireland, in the sixth century. This day
is now fixed as the 12th December, but in the Highlands
it is the shortest in the year, whatever day of the
calendar that may fall upon. In olden times it was
much esteemed, as the rhyme shows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“St. Finnan’s night of festivities,</div>
<div class="verse">And Christmas night of great cheer.”<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Besides giving a name to the days of the calendar
the saints were employed to designate local markets,
St. Kessock’s Day (<i>Fèill mo Cheasaig</i>) at Callander has
been already mentioned. St. Connan’s Day (<i>Feill Connain</i>)
is the autumn market in Glenorchy; <i>Feill
Fhaolain</i> is held at Killin; <i>Feill Ceit</i> at Kenmore; and
in other places we have <i>Feill Peadair</i>, <i>F. Aindreis</i>, etc.
Old men spoke of <i>Feill an Diomhanais</i>, the festival of
St. Idleness, a holiday frequently observed by a great
many people. <i>Latha na Sluasaid</i>, Shovel Day, means
the day of one’s burial. <i>Bliadhna na Braoisge</i>, Grinning
Year, and <i>La Luain</i>, Moon-day (<i>i.e.</i> Monday come-never),
mean the same thing, the Greek Kalends.
<i>Bliadhna nam Brisgeinean</i>, the Year of Silverweed
roots, was shortly after Culloden, and is remembered in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
Tiree as a year of great scarcity. The land had been
neglected in previous years from the disturbed state of
the country, and in spring the furrows were white with
roots (<i>brisgeinean</i>), and people made meal of them.</p>

<h3>DAYS OF THE WEEK.</h3>

<p>These play a more important part in Highland superstition
than even the seasons of the year. The names
by which they are known are not Celtic; two, Wednesday
and Thursday, are of Scandinavian or Teutonic
origin, and the rest are from the Latin. The superstitions,
as might be expected, can in most cases be
traced directly to incidents in Scripture history. The
division of time into weeks was introduced with the
Christian religion from Ireland, and the Irish must be
held responsible for the names adopted. Neither in the
names nor in the superstitions is there any trace of an
age anterior to Christianity.</p>

<p><i>Dĭ</i>, which is prefixed to each name, in the sense of
<i>day</i>, is kindred with the Latin <i>dies</i>, and occurs in
slightly modified forms in all the Celtic dialects. It is
curious that in Gaelic it occurs in no other form or combination
in the sense of “day,” and a suspicion is
thereby created that it is merely an adaptation of the
Latin word, an easier adaptation, because there are
words of similar sound and kindred meaning in Gaelic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Di-dòmhnaich</i>, SUNDAY (<i>dies Domini</i>).</h3>

<p>The name <i>Dòmhnach</i> for our Lord is not common.
It is evidently derived from the Latin <i>Dominus</i>. It
occurs in the proper name <i>Maol-Dòmhnaich</i> Ludovic,
lit. the bald one (<i>i.e.</i> the shaven priest) of our Lord, a
name still to be found in Skye, and formed like <i>Maol-Mhoire</i>,
Miles (lit. the priest of St. Mary), <i>Maol-Ciaran</i>,
<i>Maol-Ruainidh</i>, etc. There is a streamlet near Strowan,
in Blair Athole, called <i>allt Dòmhnach</i>, the streamlet of
our Lord; and a <i>Tobar an Dòmhnach</i>, the well of our
Lord, in Balmeanach, in the west of Tiree. In a
charm for fulling cloth the expression occurs, “if he (the
wearer of the cloth) enter field or fight, the full succour
of our Lord be his” (<i>Slàn chomraich an Dòmhnach da</i>).</p>

<p>The day is also known as “<i>an Dòmhnach</i>” without
the prefix of <i>di</i>. Other names are those occurring in
Scripture, Sabbath, etc.</p>

<p>The plant pulled on Sunday is, according to a proverbial
expression, without good or harm (<i>luibh an
Dòmhnach gun mhath gun chron</i>).</p>

<h3><i>Di-luain</i>, MONDAY.</h3>

<p><i>Luain</i> is said in dictionaries to be a Gaelic name for
the moon, agreeing in origin with the Latin <i>luna</i>. It
is used only in the name of this day, and in the
expression <i>la luain</i>, a poetic phrase for Monday come-never,
<i>i.e.</i> “never more.” The adjective <i>luaineach</i>, restless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
is supposed to be derived from it, but is a word
never applied to the moon. It applies to whatever
moves restlessly by fits and starts, from place to place,
without staying long in one place, and never to anything
on account of change of shape or form. Its
derivation from <i>la uaine</i>, green day, is absurd, and there
are grounds for suspicion, that <i>luain</i> is a word manufactured
by ancient Gaelic grammarians from the
Latin.</p>

<p>It was deemed unlucky to commence ploughing
(stretching the team, as it was called, <i>sìneadh na
seisrich</i>), or any kind of work on Monday. It will
be proceeded with too quickly or too slowly, according
to the adage,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Work commenced on Monday,</div>
<div class="verse">Will be (too) quick or will be (too) slow.”<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It was deemed, however, a good day for removing or
“flitting” upon, just as Saturday was the reverse.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Saturday removal is to the north,</div>
<div class="verse">Monday removal to the south,</div>
<div class="verse">Though I had but a lamb</div>
<div class="verse">On Monday I would it remove.”<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Old men called it “the key of the week” (<i>iuchair na
seachdain</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Di-màirt</i>, TUESDAY.</h3>

<p>The name is obviously enough from <i>dies martis</i>, the
Latin name.</p>

<p>This was a good day to begin ploughing upon, and
it was ominous of good luck if any of the harness broke
and the ploughing was stopped for the day. Such a
belief could exist only in the easy-going olden days.</p>

<h3><i>Di-Ciadain</i>, WEDNESDAY.</h3>

<p>Much ingenuity has been spent on the etymology of
this word by those who delight in recondite meanings,
and believe that every word in Gaelic must be traced
to a Gaelic origin. What Lhuyd says of radicals
and primitives is equally applicable to other words. It
is a very common error in etymology to endeavour to
derive all the radical words of our Western European
languages from the Latin or Greek; or indeed to
<i>derive the Primitives of any one language from any
particular tongue</i>. When we do this we seem to forget
that all have been subject to alterations, and that the
greater and more polite any nation is, the more subject
they are (partly from improvement, and partly out of a
luxurious wantonness) to remodel their language.
Nearly all words connected with ecclesiastical affairs
both in English and Gaelic have been imported from
the Latin and Greek, undergoing only such changes as
the difference of language requires. When or why the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
name of a Scandinavian deity, and not a Roman name,
was adopted by the British and Irish churches to
designate this or any other day is a different question.
We must seek (and this is a rule lamentably neglected
by Gaelic etymologists), the true explanation of words
in any language that offers one that is probable and
rational; otherwise we make “a useful art ridiculous,”
and the etymologist degenerates into “a trifling
conjecturer.”</p>

<p>The Latin name of this day is <i>dies mercurii</i>, which
name was adopted in the Welsh, Cornish, and Armoric,
but the Teutonic names are derived from the Scandinavian
deity <i>Odin</i> or <i>Woden</i>, who was supposed to
correspond to Mercury. This was the designation
adopted in Gaelic, both Irish and Scottish. Like the
French the Gaelic has no <i>w</i>, and represents that sound
by <i>g</i> or <i>c</i>. Thus, <i>gad</i>, withe; <i>gul</i>, wail; <i>cosd</i>, waste;
<i>clòimh</i>, wool; <i>cnuimh</i>, worm; <i>curaidh</i>, warrior, etc.
Sometimes, as pointed out under Whitsuntide (<i>caingis</i>),
the corresponding English sound is <i>wh</i>. So <i>Woden’s</i>-day,
Wednesday, became <i>Di-ceden</i>.</p>

<p>The derivation <i>ciad aoin’</i>, first fast, is open to the
objection that there was no fast on Wednesday in the
Celtic or any other church, that the use of the word
<i>aoin’</i>, to denote a fast, is secondary, and derived from
Friday (<i>di-haoine</i>), the true fast day, and that the final
syllable, being the essential one, would with such a
derivation, be heavily accented, instead of falling away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
into a mere terminal syllable. The grave <i>ia</i> in <i>Di-ciadain</i>
is accounted for by the <i>o</i> in Woden being long.</p>

<p>There was a malediction used to young women,
“The disease of the woman be upon you, who put the
first Wednesday comb in her head” (<i>Galar na tè chuir
a chiad chìr Chiadna na ceann</i>). The disease was that
she died childless.</p>

<p>Many would not begin sowing seed in spring, but on
this day or Thursday. It was also counted a lucky
day to begin ploughing upon.</p>

<p>A witch, in the island of Coll, being asked by a
person, who had detected her in her unhallowed pranks,
to visit a farm-house in shape of a hare, said, that as
the day was Wednesday she could do nothing. Why
her power was limited on this day does not appear.</p>

<h3><i>Di’rdaoin</i>, THURSDAY.</h3>

<p>The Latin name, <i>dies Iovis</i>, has been similarly
followed, with slight alteration, by the Cymric branch
of the Celts; while the Gaelic names are taken from
<i>Thor</i>, <i>Tor</i>, and in some dialects <i>Thordan</i>, the Scandinavian
deity, son of Odin.</p>

<p>This is a lucky day for a calf or lamb to be born
upon, for beginning the weaving of cloth, and on which
the hair should be cut, as the rhymes testify:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">(1) “Thursday the day of benign Colum-cill</div>
<div class="verse indent2">A day to take possession of sheep,</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is unlucky if Beltane day, the first of summer,
falls upon a Thursday, according to the saying, “Many
a woman will be without an infant son, when Beltane
falls on Thursday” (<i>Is iomadh té bhios gun mhacan
baoth dar is ann air Di’rdaoin bhios a Bhealltainn</i>).
M’Intosh (<i>Gael. Prov.</i>, 146) has it, “Woe to the
mother of a wizard’s son, when Beltane falls on a
Thursday.” A similar prejudice existed against
Hallowmas (<i>Samhain</i>), the first of winter, falling on
a Wednesday.</p>

<h3><i>Di-haoine</i>, FRIDAY, DIES VENORIS.</h3>

<p>Here the Gaelic names revert to the Latin. Venus
is etymologically connected with the Gael, <i>bean</i>, a
wife, as <i>Friga</i> is with the German <i>frau</i>. In Armoric
the name of the day is <i>dar guener</i>, and says Lhuyd
(p. 9) “’Tis observable that the initial <i>gu</i> is common
to the Britons, with the French, Spaniards, and Italians;
and that the Romans frequently begin such words with
an V consonant.” The Gaelic word would be pronounced
in the same manner, though spelled <i>di-Fhaoine</i>,
which probably is the more correct form.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
<i>Aoine</i> is said in dictionaries to mean a fast, but in
that sense never came into popular use, and is not
found in song or proverb.</p>

<p>The number of superstitions attached to the day
were very numerous, and this origin is to be traced to
Friday, being the day of the Crucifixion. On Good
Friday (<i>Di-haoine na Ceusa</i>), the anniversary of our
Lord’s Passion, the various beliefs had twofold force.
So much was it a belief that the powers of evil have
more power on this day than on any other, that it was
a common saying, “Friday is against the week” (<i>Tha
Di-haoine an aghaidh na seachdain</i>).</p>

<p>On Friday and on Sunday it was not deemed proper
to go and see a sick person. Most took such a visit in
anything but good part, and many would as soon see
death coming to the house as a sympathising friend.
In their opinion there was little difference.</p>

<p>The more superstitious would not allow iron to be
put in the ground, and consequently no graves were
dug and no ploughing was proceeded with. Commonly,
however, ploughing was abstained from only on Good
Friday.</p>

<p>It was not lucky (<i>sealbhach</i>) on Friday to cut one’s
hair or nails, to sharpen knives, commence work, count
animals, or go near the fire. In Argyllshire and the
Highlands generally it is deemed unlucky for marriages,
but in the south it is a favourite day, and in Appin,
Perthshire, people did not care to be married on any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
other day. The aversion of seafaring men to leave
on this day is well known.</p>

<p>On Fridays the fairies visited men’s houses, and
people were careful not to say anything to give them
offence. Friday was not called by its own name, but
“the day of yonder town” (<i>la bhaile ud thall</i>), and if
any one unfortunately mentioned the proper name, the
evil was averted by the bystanders adding “on the
cattle of yonder town.” Old women in Tiree averted
the evil consequences of sharpening knives on Friday
by saying “on the farm of Clark,” alluding to a big
strong man of that name to whom a general dislike
was entertained, and who was said to have entered
a fairy hillock and compelled the inmate to give him a
cure for his sore leg.</p>

<p>The aversion of the elves to iron was a prominent
feature in their character, and dislike to putting iron in
the ground was perhaps aversion to disturb (especially
with what the elves disliked so much) the earth under
the surface of which that easily offended race lives.
The “little folk” are quick to take offence, and dislike
hearing the name of Friday, seeing iron sharpened, or
the earth disturbed with it. When there was any occasion
to mention the creatures, all danger of evil consequences
is averted by saying, “A blessing on their journeying
and travelling, this is Friday and they will not hear us.”</p>

<p>In the western islands it was a bitter curse to wish
that “the number of Friday” or “the cross of the number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
of Friday” might come upon a person (<i>crois àireamh
na h-aoine dh’ amas ort</i>). To count three times cattle,
chickens, men, etc., on this day was followed as a certain
result by none of them being alive at the end of the
year. Many in Tiree remember that in their youth a
sure method of putting an old woman in a rage was to
begin counting her chickens on a Friday. She seldom
allowed them to get beyond three or four. The superstition
probably arose from a belief that it was on
Friday King David numbered the Children of Israel.</p>

<p>People did not like to kill a cow, a sheep, or other
beast, or cut or mark calves or lambs on Friday, and
there were many who would not allow their cattle to be
shifted from one place to another. They would not
alter their fold. If, <i>e.g.</i> the day was come for removing
cows to the summer hill pastures, the more superstitious
would not allow it to be done if the day was
Friday.</p>

<p>As work commenced on Monday proceeded too
quickly or too slowly, work began on Friday was
said to be always hurriedly done, “it will be running”
(<i>bi i na ruith</i>). “A person born on Friday is always
in a hurry” (<i>Bi neach a rugadh Di-haoine driopail</i>);
hence the malediction, “The running, or hurry, of
Friday be upon you” (<i>Ruith na h-aoine ort</i>).</p>

<p>“A threatening Friday makes a tearful Saturday”
(<i>’Si ’n Aoine bhagarach ni ’n Sathurna deurach</i>), and
if it came on to rain early on Friday, or (as the saying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
was) if Friday caught the rain “in its mouth” (<i>Nan
glacadh an t-aoine na bhial e</i>), it would be wet all day.</p>

<h3><i>Di-sathuirne</i>, SATURDAY (<i>Dies Saturni</i>).</h3>

<p>This, as might be expected, was not deemed a lucky
day to begin work upon. It was not deemed of much
consequence whether ploughing began or not, but the
manufacture of cloth should on no account be begun.
“The warp prepared on Saturday will have the delay
of the seven Saturdays upon it” (<i>An rud theid a dheilbh
Di-Sathuirne, bi stad nan seachd Sathurn’ air</i>). No
spinning was to be done after sunset, but other work
might proceed as usual. All work should stop at
9 p.m. It is still considered a bad thing among the old
people in Kintail to work past that hour.</p>

<p>There is a man in Tiree who will not allow a newly-engaged
servant to come home to enter on his service
on Saturday. On one occasion, when the term-day
happened to be Saturday, he persuaded the servant
man to come on Friday, though only to stand in the
house for a few minutes, that the evil omen might be
averted.</p>

<p>New moon on Saturday was deemed a presage of
stormy weather. “Saturday light goes seven times
mad before it goes out” (<i>Solus Sathurna gabhaidh e na
seachd cuthaich mun d’ theid e mach</i>).</p>

<p>An evil wish is “The end of the seven Saturdays
be upon you” (<i>Deire nan seachd Sathurn’ ort</i>), Macintosh’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
<i>Prov.</i>, p. 78; and in Cowal it is a vicious saying
of one woman to another, “Worse than that will come
upon you, the disease of the seven Saturdays will come
upon you” (<i>Thig na ’s miosa na sin ort, thig galar nan
seachd Sathurn’ ort</i>).</p>

<p>The objection to removing on Saturday has been
already mentioned under Monday.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> The same objection
is entertained in Ireland.</p>

<p>The end of the week is very grateful to the labouring
man. “Alas! and alas! is Monday, but my love is
Saturday” (<i>och is och! Di-luain, ach ’s e mo luaidh Di-Sathuirne</i>).</p>

<h3>WEATHER WISDOM, ETC.</h3>

<p>Expressions denoting high wind are: “the blowing
of hillocks out of their places” (<i>seideadh nan cnoc</i>), “a
wind to take the tails off horses” (<i>Bheireadh i na
h-earbuill bhar nan each</i>), and “blow the barn over
the house” (<i>chuir an t-sabhuill thar an tighe</i>); heavy
rain takes “pieces out of the ground” (<i>mìrean as an
talamh</i>), and gives “milk to the whales” (<i>bainne do na
muca mara</i>), it being supposed that in heavy rain whales
lie on the surface to cool themselves; heavy snow
“confines the infirm to their cots” (<i>chròdhadh e na
giùigirean</i>), strong robust men can go about their business.
A dead calm is called “the calm of birds” (<i>fia’ nan
ian</i>); on days when not a hair is moved by the wind,
and the sea is unruffled, the young fry of fish come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
the surface, and sea-birds, themselves also conspicuous
in such weather, can look about them for their prey.</p>

<p>The first breath of wind after a calm comes from the
south, hence “When the wind is lost look for it in the
south” (<i>Nuair a bhios gaoth air chall iarr a deas i</i>).
After a heavy fall of rain the wind comes west, as is
told in the saying, “West wind after fat rain” (<i>Gaoth
’n iar ’n déigh uisge reamhar</i>). If frost comes on, when
rivers and pools are swollen, and the ground is very
wet, it does not last long; “the freezing of the full
pool does not rest long” (<i>reodhadh an lodain làin, cha
mhair e fada</i>). The heaviest rain comes from the
north (or rather north-east), and the longest drought
from the south; “there is no rain but from the north,
or lasting dry weather but from the south” (<i>Cha-n
uisge ach o’n tuath, ’s cha turadh buan ach o’n deas</i>).
The frequency with which the violence of the wind
moderates after a shower of rain has given rise to the
proverb “after wind comes rain” (<i>an déigh gaoth mhor
thig uisge</i>), to denote that after loud merriment and
laughter come sorrow and the cares brought by reflection.
“It is north wind that dissipates mist” (<i>’s i gaoth tuath
sgaoileas ceò</i>); “the first day of south wind, and the
third day of north wind” (<i>chiad latha de ’n ghaoth deas
’s an treas latha de ’n ghaoth tuath</i>), <i>i.e.</i> they are
moderate then, and are best for crossing ferries on.
“A speckled chequered summer makes a white, sunny
harvest” (<i>ni samhradh breac riabhach fogharadh geal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
grianach</i>). The south-west, being the direction from
which rain commonly comes, is known in the Hebrides
as “<i>Cachlaidh na Buigeuisg</i>,” the gateway of soft
weather.</p>

<h3>THE MOON.</h3>

<p>Both the sun (<i>a Ghrian</i>) and moon (<i>a Ghealach</i>)
are feminine in Gaelic, and the names are simply
descriptive of their appearance. There is no trace
of a Sun-God or Moon-Goddess. The root <i>gr</i> in <i>Grian</i>
denotes horrent or bristling, and alludes to the sun’s
rays. It is said by some writers, that the name is connected
with Apollo Grannua, but the connection is
a mere accidental similarity in the initial letters. The
root <i>gr</i>, denoting what is streaming or bristling, occurs
in <i>gruag</i>, a wig, flowing hair; <i>greann</i>, a surly look,
a bristling of the hair as on an enraged dog; <i>grāin</i>,
aversion, from the turning up of nose and stomach
and bristling appearance of one much disgusted, so
ab<i>horr</i>ence, etc. <i>Gealach</i>, the moon, is from <i>geal</i>,
white. The names <i>luan</i>, <i>easga</i>, or <i>easgann</i> are given
in dictionaries, but have disappeared from common
use. With the former is supposed to be connected
<i>luaineach</i>, restless, and <i>luaisg</i>, to move. <i>R’</i> denotes
any planet.</p>

<p>The moment the moon begins to increase is called
<i>gob soillse</i> (lit. the bill or beak of the light). The
height of the tide, which follows his changes, is <i>bolg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
reothairt</i> (lit. the swollen womb of spring tide). The
moon’s increase is <i>fās</i>, and when waning she is <i>san
earra-dhubh</i> (lit. in her black boundaries).<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>At the instant the moon begins to increase, (<i>air
gob na gealaiche</i>) the horns of cows are loose on
their pith (<i>slabhagan</i>), and may be pulled off and
stuck on again. It is told that a dispute having
arisen on one occasion as to the correctness of
an almanac, about the moon’s change, the old man
who raised the question proved himself to be in the
right by turning round and drawing the horn from
one of his cows, as a sheath is taken from a knife,
and sticking it on again. The story is told of a
man who lived in Sconser, Isle of Skye, of more
than one person in Tiree, and was doubtless told of
people in various places.</p>

<p>It was said that there is never any north wind at
<i>gob gealaich</i>.</p>

<p>The first time an unmarried person sees the new
moon, he should stoop down and lift whatever
meets his hand. If, on taking it to the light, any
hair be found among it, its colour will prove to be
that of the future husband or wife. It is unlucky to
see the new moon for the first time when washing
one’s hands, or with the hand on the face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>In olden times great regard was paid to the increase
and wane of the moon. Garden seeds, as onions,
kail, etc., if sown in the increase, ran to seed, but if
sown in the wane, grew as pot-herbs. Withies or
slender twigs (<i>Caol</i>) intended for creels and baskets
were cut only in the wane. Twigs cut in the increase
proved brittle. Trees cut in the increase were believed
to bud again, but not those cut in the wane. Eggs
laid during the wane were preserved for hatching,
rather than those laid during the increase. Hens
came from the former; cocks from the latter. Birds
hatched in the increase were deemed difficult to rear,
and it was doubtful if any of them would ultimately
survive. Hence <i>Eòin an fhàs</i>, birds of the increase,
is a name given to weakly pining children. They
are worthless for hatching.</p>

<p>Many would not cut (<i>i.e.</i> castrate) an animal, calf,
or foal, or pig, during the increase of the moon, and
it was a belief that cows seek the bull only in the
first and third quarters of the moon, and never at
neap tides. A man in Islay pretended to tell, from
the time the cow paid her visit to the bull, whether
her offspring would prove a bull-calf or a cow-calf.
If in the first quarter, the former; if in the wane,
the latter.</p>

<p>The second moon in autumn, the harvest moon,
or first after the autumnal equinox, was variously
known as <i>Gealach an abachaidh</i>, “the ripening moon,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
from a belief that crops ripen as much by it as
they do during the day; <i>Gealach bhuidhe nam broc</i>,
“the badger’s yellow moon,” these wary animals being
engaged, it was said, in taking home their winter
supplies; <i>Gealach an t-sealgair</i>, “the hunter’s moon”;
and the last moon in harvest, extending for a month
before Hallowmas (<i>Samhain</i>). The first of winter was
known as <i>Gealach a ruadhain</i>, “the reddening moon,”
during which vegetation grew as much by night as
in the day.</p>

<p>It was said there was no north wind at the exact
period of the appearance of new moon (<i>gob gealaich</i>).</p>

term is entirely unknown. It is told of a Tiree man of the last generation,
that he was promised a croft, or piece of land, by the then
chamberlain of the island, who was a native of the mainland, and said,
“Your name will be put on the rent-roll on St. Brendan’s Day.” The
Tiree man went home and consulted his godfather (<i>goistidh</i>) as to what
day the factor meant. “I really don’t know,” said his godfather, “unless
it be the day of judgment.”</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

<h2>START: FULL LICENSE<br />
<br />
THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
